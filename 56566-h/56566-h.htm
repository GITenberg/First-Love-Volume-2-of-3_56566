<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the day, Lord Borrowdale’s attentions
to Julia were public and unremitting, while
the infatuated, unhappy Edmund witnessed it
all in growing sorrow of heart. Had he then,
he asked himself, already yielded to a passion
so irrational, so dishonourable?—No. He
was not quite so mad—quite so base. Had
he not always loved Julia? loved her when she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
was a child—when there could be nothing
questionable in the nature of his attachment?—Certainly
he had, sincerely, fondly loved
her.</p>

<p>Julia, too, in the course of the day, felt a
little uncomfortable; she thought that, notwithstanding
the friendly conversation of the
morning, Edmund, some how, did not seem
satisfied. He was not cheerful, he was not
frank and obliging as usual; he was not, in
short, the least like himself! Could it be, that
he fancied he had been but coolly received on
his return? Frances and herself used always
to make such rejoicing when he came home;
but that was when they were children. And
yesterday, there was such a hurry with company—yet,
possibly, Edmund might have thought
it proceeded from silly pride, because there
were strangers by, or some such worthless feeling!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
She longed for an opportunity of speaking
to him kindly on the subject, and doing
away with such an idea, if indeed it existed.
But he now rather seemed to avoid her, while
Lady Susan always happened to be speaking to
him just when she was intending to do so.</p>

<p>At dinner, Lord Borrowdale handed in Julia;
for Lord Morven appeared to think it necessary
to resign in his favour. Not so Henry, who
not only secured the place on the other side of
our heroine, but contrived to engross much of
her conversation. This was but poor consolation
to Edmund; it argued indifference to Lord
Borrowdale, certainly; but then Henry, though
without title, was at least nearly her equal in
birth, being her own cousin. And it was possible—barely
possible, that she might be attached
to him: he had been at home once or twice
when it had not been in Edmund’s power to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
return. His observations this morning might
have been prompted by jealousy.</p>

<p>After dinner preparations were made for a
sail on the lake. Edmund observed Lord Borrowdale,
from the moment they left the house,
eagerly secure to himself the care of Julia.
He, however, walked on the other side. But
Lady Susan, passing them as they arrived at
the place of embarkation, ran on the gang-board
alone; then, stopping half way in alarm,
and balancing herself with difficulty, yet refusing
the aid of the bargemen, she called on
Captain Montgomery for his assistance, declaring
he was the only person who understood
boats, and that she should not consider herself
safe in any other hands. The gallant Captain
could not disobey the summons, nor, having
obeyed it, avoid continuing his especial protection
to the lady; while Henry coming up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
at the moment, drew Julia’s arm over his with
all the freedom of cousinship. The boats, after
crossing the lake, coasted along beneath the
shade of trees, which hung from the steep
rocks almost into the water, while the bare
mountain tops, towering far above, were canopied
by the heavens, and again reflected in the
clear lake, where yet another sky appeared as
far beneath.</p>

<p>“This—this is the spot!” exclaimed Mr.
Jackson, “to try the effect of the echoes.”
They had arrived, as he spoke, opposite the
opening to a little valley. A chain of stupendous
mountains arose on either side, and
one of a conical form, partly shrouded in a
white mist which had rolled up from the lake,
terminated the far perspective.</p>

<p>The rowers lay on their oars, and the
French-horns commenced an air. Immediately,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
a gigantic voice from within the steep
side of the nearest mountain took it up; the
next joined in, and the next; but each less
loud, till the receding echoes, in journeying
round the lake, reached rugged Borrowdale:
there they seemed broken off for some seconds;
but soon a distant clamour arose, as proceeding
from the thousand mountain tops of that
desolate region: the sounds were flung further
and nearer, then succeeded each other more
rapidly, then became slower in their repeats.
At length they came forth again, and continued
travelling round the lake on the opposite
side; but now, increasing in loudness as they
once more approached the boats, and loudest
when they reached the mountain which formed
the second portal to the little valley already
described, and in front of the opening to which
the boats still lay. Then fainter, and fainter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
notes proceeded up the vale, and, at length,
at its furthest extremity, died away altogether.</p>

<p>After a pause of perfect silence, to ascertain
that no return of the echoes could be expected,
Julia was eagerly called upon to sing. She
asked Edmund to join her in the echo duet,
and smiled as she spoke to him. Half his
unhappiness vanished in a moment, and the
song commenced. The tones of Edmund’s
voice were full and firm. His singing, however,
derived its principal charm from his
manner, which had in it so much of truth and
nature, that you could almost fancy him one
addressing you with no object but to persuade
by the purport of his words; while the mere
inflexions of the voice, in sympathising with
that purport, unconsciously formed themselves
into varied and melodious harmonies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>As for Julia’s voice, it chanced to be one of
those wonders, rare as the blow of the aloe!
Cultivation had, of course, not been spared;
but it was its native power and unexampled
compass which were so remarkable. Its variety
of capabilities too delighted, for in soft or
playful passages, its tones had, as we have
somewhere remarked, an almost infantine sweetness.
On the present occasion, the scenery,
the music, the effect of the echoes, all were
inspirations; and the notes which escaped
from her lips, gradually arose, till imagination
could fancy them travelling on above the clouds,
and the listeners felt an involuntary impulse
to look upwards, as in pursuit of them. Then,
as the air varied, the voice would suddenly
fall full and plump on the truest and richest
harmonies below, while the higher tones were
repeated far above by now receding, now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
approaching echoes. Soon did the whole wild
region round about seem peopled by invisible
beings; wandering voices called from every
pointed crag of every mountain top; while the
steep-sided rock, near which the boat still lay,
appeared to contain some dark enchanter, who,
all the time in hurried and mysterious accents,
spoke from within. Even every little tufted
island seemed to have its own, one, wild inhabitant;
for each, from some projecting point
or hidden bower, sent forth a voice, however
faint in its tone or inarticulate in its utterance.
Julia’s enthusiasm arose so high, that she not
only exerted every power of her extraordinary
voice, but, when she had concluded, forgetting
how considerable a part she had borne in the
general concert, she cried, “Beautiful! beautiful!”
in absolute extacy at the echoes.</p>

<p>“Beautiful! beautiful!” exclaimed Edmund<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
at the same moment, meaning, probably, Julia’s
singing, but certainly not his own.</p>

<p>“Beautiful! beautiful!” repeated the voice
of thunder from within the adjacent perpendicular
rock.</p>

<p>“Beautiful! beautiful!” ran along the invisible
orchestra above. Frances could keep
her countenance no longer at the self-gratulations
of the performers, visible and invisible;
she laughed out, and a merry peal from all the
echoes followed immediately.</p>

<p>“This is too bad,” cried Mr. Jackson, starting,
(to the great endangering of the boat,) from
the attitude of delighted attention in which he
had, since the commencement of the song, remained
motionless, “this is too bad, to break
up the delicious spell with such a farce as this!”</p>

<p>The sun was now near setting: a homeward
course was therefore proposed; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the breeze being favourable, a sail was spread,
which, not only greatly assisted the rowers,
but added much to the picturesque appearance
of the gay barge in which our party sat, as,
quitting its coasting position, it dipped like a
white winged sea-bird into the dark bosom of
the lake, and crossed to the Keswick side.</p>

<p>When they were about to land, Edmund
paused a moment to consider whether he ought
not to leave Julia to the care of Lord Borrowdale;
but she happened at the moment, to
point out a well remembered landing-place,
beneath an overhanging bower of branches,
reminding him how often he had rowed Frances
and herself to the spot, and remarking further,
a little path, sometimes discernible, among the
trees in which they used to walk. Such are
the important events which change the resolves
of lovers! He gave up all thoughts of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
sacrifice he had meditated; hastened to assist
her out of the boat; and, as she stepped on the
beach, drew the hand he held over his arm, and
walked on unconscious of an accident which
followed immediately, and which we shall here
describe. The hold of the boat-hook on the
roots of a stump giving way, the boat was sent,
for a few moments, a-drift; and not only was
the bargeman, who stood with one foot on the
edge of the boat and the other on a projecting
piece of rock, precipitated into the water, but
so also was Lord Borrowdale, who was, at the
instant, in the very act of leaping ashore to join
our heroine. This caused such immoderate
laughing among the rest of the gentlemen, and
so much pretty terror among the ladies, that
Edmund and Julia were not missed till they
became quite separated from the party. A
most inviting path lay before them, which, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
ascending for a time, descended a steep and
wooded slope, to an overarched opening through
the trees, just where a single plank crossed a
little stream, at a considerable height from the
water.</p>

<p>Arrived on this rustic bridge they stood, the
beauty of the scene suspending the hand of
Edmund, which he had laid on a little paling
gate at its further extremity, with the purpose
of opening it, as it formed the barrier between
our wanderers and a fresh cut hay-field.</p>

<p>The sun was so low in the horizon that the
little mounds of grass which every hand was
hastily throwing up for the night at the far
end of the meadow, cast their lengthened
shadows across half its extent, while the
setting beam was still bronzing their tops,
together with the faces, garments, and implements
of the rustic groups employed around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
them. At the same moment a full moon, just
rising to view on the opposite verge of the
heavens, was glittering through the branches
of some dark firs that terminated the prospect
in that direction.</p>

<p>Julia, who had several appropriate speeches
ready, had been all day only waiting for an
opportunity to say them; for she had reasoned
herself into a belief that it would be dreadful
to let Edmund think himself neglected for
newer or gayer objects; but, some how, all
this preparation had made a thing so simple in
itself, as joking Edmund for being affronted,
seem quite awful; and in consequence, her
heart was beating so fast, that she was waiting
for it to stop before she could begin to speak.</p>

<p>“Edmund,” she at length contrived to say,
turning and offering her hand; but the foolish
fluttering of her heart redoubled, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
stopped short. Edmund started, caught the
offered hand, and, puzzled and delighted, pressed
it to his lips. She laughed, blushed, and
drew her hand away, saying—</p>

<p>“I see, Edmund, you are silly enough to be
quite jealous.”</p>

<p>This was rather an unfortunate choice of
expression; for Edmund, colouring to excess,
began to stammer out—“I—me—oh—a, I
have a—I—”</p>

<p>“I dare say you think,” continued Julia,
who had no suspicion of the kind of jealousy,
which on mention of the word, had presented
itself to Edmund’s fancy—“I dare say you
think we did not appear as glad to see you as
usual, when you arrived so by surprise yesterday;
but you came in in so hurried a
manner—and—among so many strangers—that—that—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>“Indeed, Julia, I—you—” again stammered
Edmund.</p>

<p>“I am sure none of us intended to be unkind,”
continued Julia, “—or less glad, I mean,
of your safe return.”</p>

<p>“You are too good to be unkind to any one,
Julia,” said Edmund, with a sigh. Julia still
fancying his manner seemed strangely dissatisfied,
began to feel offended in her turn, and
a rather awkward pause followed. At length,
she compelled herself to make another effort,
and said, with a reasoning tone—</p>

<p>“You cannot suppose, Edmund, that any of
your friends at Lodore regard you less, merely
from your having been a few years from home!
Indeed, if you could know how highly, both
grandmamma and Mr. Jackson always speak of
you, you would not think so!” He made no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
reply; for it was neither grandmamma nor Mr.
Jackson that he was thinking of.</p>

<p>“I believe,” she added, trying to laugh, “it
really was all I had heard about ‘Captain
Montgomery, the gallant Captain Montgomery!’
which made me find it so difficult to
imagine Edmund, who used to play with
Frances and myself here in these woods, and
the said terrible Captain fighting the French
and destroying the Turks on the high seas,
one and the same person!”</p>

<p>“Ungentle employment, it must be confessed!”
he replied, with a faint smile.</p>

<p>“Oh—I don’t mean that,” said Julia, “I—But
really, Edmund, I think,” she added,
gravely, “I have made you apologies enough
to restore any reasonable being to good humour.”</p>

<p>“You make me apologies!” he commenced:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
but Julia, as she turned from him, with something
of indignation at his supposed obstinacy,
forgetting the narrow plank on which she stood,
slipped her foot, and would certainly have
fallen into the water had he not caught her in
his arms, and lifted her to sure footing. Julia,
partly from alarm, and partly from the previous
exertion of her spirits in saying so much,
was a good deal overcome, and even shed tears.
The sight of these threw Edmund off his guard.
“Would to heaven, Julia!” he exclaimed,
“that I were indeed your brother! entitled to
the happy privilege of guarding one more precious
than life from every danger! of sheltering
one dearer than happiness itself—from
every sorrow!”</p>

<p>Thunderstruck at his own rashness, he
ceased. A smile through her tears was Julia’s
reply; for, as she was not expecting, or thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
of a love speech, she understood from what
had been said, only that friendship and good
humour were restored, and Edmund become
more like himself. A long silence, however,
followed: when Julia at last said, in rather a
hesitating manner, and at the same time with
an effort at playfulness, “Frances and I have
always called you brother, you know, can you
not fancy yourself such, and take as good care
of us as if you were really our brother?”</p>

<p>This was a trying appeal; and the beating
of Edmund’s heart, (closer to which he imperceptibly
drew Julia’s arm as she spoke) shewed
him that he must not trust himself with the
use of language. Another silence, therefore,
followed, and they walked slowly on. In a
little time, Edmund, as if thinking aloud, gave,
perhaps, unconscious utterance to what seemed
to be the result of his meditations, saying:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
“No, no!—it cannot be required of me, to
root out the permitted affections of childhood
from my heart!—It were too impossible!—too
unnatural!”</p>

<p>“And who wishes you to do so?” asked his
companion, with a quickness that shewed how
little she understood his feelings.</p>

<p>At this moment, the rest of the party came
in sight at some distance; and Edmund, as if
fearful of interruption, turned suddenly round,
and, in hurried and agitated accents, said,
“Julia! you permit me to feel for you the
affection of a brother! you permit me, you
say, to evince that feeling by care of your welfare,
your safety, your happiness. Should I
ever be so unfortunate as to extend to what
may seem presumption on your goodness, the
dear, the sacred privilege—check—but do not,
do not utterly condemn me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>He paused a moment for breath, then, with
effort, recommenced thus: “Your family is
the home of all my affections! Could it be—should
it be otherwise? Yet, in cherishing
those affections, so natural, in my circumstances,
so inextinguishable, there may occur
moments when I may be tempted to forget
that I myself stand alone, must ever stand
alone, an unconnected, a nameless stranger!”</p>

<p>Here the joining of the party as they came
up, laughing and recounting Lord Borrowdale’s
adventure, put an end to this dangerous conference.
Its results, however, coloured the
future destinies of both the young people. If
Edmund had previously formed safer resolves,
they were now lost in the belief that Julia was
in no danger of discovering in him, or sharing
herself any sentiments, exceeding the bounds of
that friendship which it was, (under the circumstance,)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
but right and natural should subsist
between them; while any deficiency (he
argued with himself) in the manifestation of
brotherly regard on his part, would require the
very explanation it was his duty not to make.
He must, therefore, shew her every silent, unpretending,
affectionate attention; every mark
of brotherly regard; while his own imprudent
passion must lie for ever buried in his own
bosom!</p>

<p>He must indeed correct its mad and wild intensity!
The habit of being in her society,
would, he hoped, assist him to do so! would
moderate the extraordinary effect that society
now had upon him! would enable him to sober
down his feelings into those of a truly
affectionate brother, really solicitous for the
welfare of a sister he sincerely loves.</p>

received every devotion that a growing and
blinding passion could suggest, except open
declaration: yet did confessions pass from
heart to heart every time their eyes met, while
their understandings pretended to know nothing
about the matter; for each of them took
care not to ask themselves any questions on
the subject as long as they felt so perfectly
happy as they now did in each other’s society.
Even the attentions of Lord Borrowdale soon
almost ceased to pain Edmund: he could distinctly
see that they were, at least, indifferent,
if not annoying to Julia; and, though he did
not dare to ask himself why, the conviction
was a source of infinite joy to him!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>The gay mornings of the regatta, dinner
company every day, and dancing every evening
continued for some time, while the very public
attentions of his said lordship towards our
heroine; and the jest, or, as it is technically
phrased, the quiz about our hero and Lady
Susan, tended to blind every one to the growth
of the deep rooted attachment which was thus
hourly possessing itself of every feeling and
faculty of heart and of soul in Julia and in
Edmund. Yet still were they brother and
sister; and, in their own opinion, behaving
with the greatest prudence; for love was not
once mentioned by Edmund, and, as to Julia,
she never even thought of it, she only felt it!</p>

<p>“How good, how amiable it is of Julia,”
thought Edmund, “to be so kind to a friendless
stranger!”</p>

<p>“Who could be unkind to Edmund!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
thought Julia. “The gentleness of his manners
win upon one so; the expression of his
countenance is so interesting; his very smile
is so nearly allied to melancholy that any one,
with the least feeling, must dread the idea of
causing him a moment’s pain.”</p>

<p>He, for his part, could not long deceive himself
as to the nature of his own sentiments;
but he thought there was no harm in cherishing
them, while he could flatter himself that
because he was not declaring he was concealing
them. Or, had he thought otherwise,
the temptation was, perhaps, too strong to be
resisted.</p>

<p>He could not be blind to the pleasure with
which Julia received every little mark of silent
attention from him, and the blissful sensation
which glowed within his breast at such moments
was not to be foregone at the faint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
instigations of a judgment bewildered by the
influence of an absorbing passion. Yet he
certainly fancied, that it was only his own
futurity he was sacrificing for a dream of present
felicity. Whatever he sometimes <em>felt</em>
Julia’s <em>feelings</em> to be, he undoubtedly always
<em>thought</em> them the generous friendship she had
promised him should ever be his; and he thus
reasoned with himself, that, as she had distinctly
permitted him to feel and declare a
brother’s affection for her, it was to be expected,
that she would receive with complacency
those unpretending marks of regard
which belong peculiarly to friendship. And,
as Frances was often even more openly kind
in her manner to him, all was, of course, as
it should be. As to himself—it was no matter
about himself! he even felt a kind of satisfaction
in thinking, that when he could no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
longer enjoy the delirium of happiness under
the dominion of which he now existed—when
the hour of separation must come—why, then
his misery should be as wild, as unlimited as
his felicity was now! still would he watch
for the dangerous smile, and when its light
began to dawn on the features of Julia, he
would have opened his heart to its intoxicating
influence, had instantaneous death been the
immediate and foreseen consequence. She
often observed a shade of melancholy on the
brow of Edmund, but she also observed that
it gave way to sunny joy when a look, a word,
or a smile of hers was directed towards him.
To possess the power of giving happiness in
a manner so easy and so innocent, to one for
whom she did not deny that she had, all her
life, had a very tender sisterly affection; to
possess such a power and not to use it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
not in the affectionate nature of Julia. She
did exert it every day, every hour, and when
she saw Edmund’s countenance light up with
a beam caught from her smile, she felt a degree
of pleasure that sometimes startled her;
but she never ventured to ask herself whether
or not all this was to lead to any ultimate
results. Sometimes indeed, she recollected,
with a sensation of panic, that Edmund must
again leave Lodore House, must again return
to the sea, to hardships, to dangers; and then
she would strive to banish the scaring thoughts
that crowded in upon her, but the next time
she addressed Edmund, there would be a tenderness
in the accents of her voice, a something
indefinable in the expression of her eyes,
that would shake his whole soul to its foundation,
bewilder his every thought, undo his
every resolve, and place him, passive as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
were, in the hands of a fate, at once too
overwhelming and too delightful to be resisted.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the whirl of gaiety, the noise
of merriment, was still going on around them.
Frances was the ringleader of the quizzers of
Lady Susan, and her ladyship evidently liked
being quizzed, so that Frances did not think
mercy necessary. The subject did not amuse
Julia near so much as it did her sister, but
then, Julia was always of a graver cast. As
for Edmund, he considered the whole business
so complete a jest, that he took it very good
humouredly, and received Lady Susan’s attentions
with great politeness. He even found
it necessary, not unfrequently, to dance with
her ladyship, or hand her in or out of a room,
a carriage, or a boat, when he saw that she
had actually been left for him. Sometimes
too, he coloured and looked, involuntarily, towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Julia, when pert young ladies told him,
that they looked upon him as no better than
a married man! He coloured too, and more
deeply, when men told him that, faith, he
might make his fortune if he were not the
most egregious blockhead in existence. That
Lady Susan had fifty thousand pounds, was
one of the best connexions in the kingdom,
and a very pretty young woman beside, a thing
scarcely to be looked for where so many other
advantages were combined. Even Mrs. Montgomery
and Mr. Jackson, agreed together,
but privately, that Edmund was fortunate in
the probability there was of his making so
desirable a match.</p>

<p>They determined that it was best to let matters
take their course, and not to say anything
about it to Edmund. They also agreed that
the subject was much too delicate to be mentioned
to either Lord or Lady Arandale, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
must themselves see what was going on. Lord
and Lady Arandale, however, saw only that
their daughter flirted a little, (a thing they
were very well accustomed to see,) for the
quizzing, which was the chief part of the business,
was, of course, kept within decorous
bounds in their presence. Julia, when the subject
was long dwelt upon by others, sometimes
felt not quite comfortable, (without, however,
asking herself why,) and this uneasiness, slight
as it was, vanished the moment she met the
eye of Edmund, or that he spoke to her, on
the most indifferent topic.</p>

<p>But to return to Mrs. Montgomery and Mr.
Jackson, they were so extravagantly partial to
Edmund themselves, and had for so many years
strengthened each other in the belief that there
was no doubt of his being the son of a noble family;
no doubt, in short, of the truth of the
statements in the nurse’s letter; that they did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
not see the impropriety of a match between him
and Lady Susan in the glaring light in which it
would have been viewed by most others. They
thought their inward conviction that his birth
was equal to her ladyship’s, when joined with
his own great merit, his amiability in private,
and high standing character in public life, quite
sufficient to outweigh the trifling circumstances
of their never having been able to discover,
exactly, who he was; and of his having
no property but his captain’s pay, and his
fifteen thousand pounds prize-money. What
Mrs. Montgomery might have thought of all
this, had the subject been brought nearer home
by the knowledge that it was to Julia Edmund
was attached, it is hard to say; for the best of
us can seldom judge impartially when we ourselves,
or those we love, are concerned. There
are few mothers who do not expect their sons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
to marry such women as, were they their
daughters, they would not give to such men
as their sons. But Mrs. Montgomery was
spared all alarm respecting the intimacy between
her grand-daughters and adopted son,
by Edmund’s supposed sudden admiration of
Lady Susan, commencing on the very evening
of his arrival; and the fuss, as we before observed,
which every one had since made, about
their mutual attachment.</p>

<p>There was also another blind to Mrs. Montgomery’s
penetration, in the marked and troublesome
attentions of Henry to his cousin
Julia, beside whom he was generally to be seen,
while Edmund, by the contrivance of others,
was dancing with or handing about Lady
Susan. Mrs. Montgomery, in short, was very
uneasy about it, and even lectured her nephew
on the subject: for she knew how disagreeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
such a thing would be to Lord L⸺. Lord
Borrowdale, too, who would have been a perfectly
eligible match, was equally marked in
his attentions; yet it was impossible to say,
which Julia preferred: she generally smiled
and looked happy, and this was all that could
be ascertained. The lovers the while, strange
to say, had taken no alarm, if we except Edmund’s
first day or two of endless fears; since
which, a tacit, and, to themselves, unacknowledged
conviction of each other’s affection, had
grown up in the heart of each, keeping peace
within in spite of all outward occurrences.
The miseries of doubt, the tortures of alternate
hopes and fears, were, alas! reserved for a
future stage of their attachment.</p>

<p>Edmund, indeed, was a little disturbed, one
day, by Mrs. Montgomery’s asking him, which
he thought Julia received with most favour, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
attentions of Lord Borrowdale, or those of her
cousin: adding, how much she disapproved of
Henry’s conduct in the business; and requesting
that Edmund, when they returned on
board, would give him leave of absence as
seldom as possible. “For,” continued the
old lady, “I have heard many sensible people
say, that the sympathy which cousins naturally
feel towards each other as relatives, is very apt
to become love, (or, what is just as mischievous
in its consequences, to be mistaken for it,) if
young persons are allowed to be too much
together. Now Lord Borrowdale, though a
match of which her father would perfectly
approve, is not, you know, near so handsome
as Henry; who certainly has,” she
added, with a sigh, “a great look of poor
Maria.” She next adverted, but slightly,
(having determined not to discuss the point at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
present,) to Edmund’s own prospects with
respect to Lady Susan. He had either fallen
into a reverie, or he thought the subject too
ridiculous to be treated seriously; for he
merely said, with an air of great indifference,
and in reply to more than one hitherto unanswered
observation of Mrs. Montgomery’s,
“Oh, ma’am, that, you know, can never be
any thing but a jest.” Immediately after,
however, changing his manner, he broke forth
into an energetic, and almost passionate speech
on the impossibility of one situated as he was,
one who had no home, no country, no kindred;
who knew not to what rank in society he belonged;
who had not even a name, but by
courtesy, and who, therefore, could not bestow
one; ever thinking of marrying any being, however
dearly, however fondly cherished their idea
might be to the latest moment of existence!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>All this was said with much feeling; for
Julia was in every thought; while Mrs. Montgomery
heard in it no denial of his attachment
to Lady Susan; but, on the contrary, an implied
confession of how much he regretted the
obstacles which stood in the way of their union.
She was beginning to say something, intended
to raise her desponding favourite a little, in
his own opinion, when the conversation was
interrupted by the entrance of Lord Borrowdale.</p>

<p>Edmund left the room half awakened from
his dream of bliss; and, therefore, far from
happy. The uneasy feeling, however, lasted
but till he had found Julia; met her eye, and
seen her smile; and then vanished with a
celerity, which none can understand but those
who have felt the powerful, internal evidence,
a look can convey.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span> often happened to walk out before
breakfast. Sometimes Frances was with her,
and sometimes not; but Edmund always happened
to join her.</p>

<p>One morning the three were walking together;
the sisters, with their usual friendly
familiarity, leaning each on an arm of our
hero, whom they always treated as a brother;
when Frances began, in a laughing manner, to
ask him how soon his marriage with Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Susan was to take place. Edmund tried to
smile, but sighed very heavily.</p>

<p>“No! so it is really serious!” cried Frances.
Julia too, commenced a sort of sigh, but, as
soon as she was aware that she had done so,
she closed her lips, that the breath might descend
without sound. Edmund, on whom, as
we have just observed, she was leaning, felt the
slight movement, and was strangely gratified;
not that he presumed to assign any cause to
the sigh.</p>

<p>“You know, Frances,” he said, in reply to
the question about Lady Susan, “that business
is completely a jest! I wonder, by the
bye, her ladyship is not offended at being
made the subject of a jest. But, were it otherwise,”
he continued, with solemnity, “were
she indeed the object of an overwhelming passion—were
she indeed the being whose looks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
whose words, whose smile gave value to each
moment of existence—were she in short the
object of a <em>first love</em>, which you know they say
cannot be torn up without carrying with it the
very fibres of the heart itself, and leaving it
incapable of future energy; (I do not say that
I should attempt to eradicate the sentiment,
no, I should cherish its very miseries as preferable
far to the barren waste, the joyless void
of a heart weaned from love;) but such feelings,
whatever it might cost me to suppress
them, should never be permitted to pass my
lips, while mystery hung over my birth.”</p>

<p>“But may you not be loved for your own
sake, Edmund, whoever you are?” said Frances,
“and for the sake of the high character
you have established for yourself, as Mr. Jackson
says? I am sure I could not love you better,
nor grandmamma, nor Julia, nor Mr. Jackson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
if you turned out to be the eldest son of
his Majesty, and rightful heir to the throne of
Great Britain!”</p>

<p>Edmund looked round involuntarily towards
Julia, but her eyes were on the ground.</p>

<p>“I hope, Frances,” he said, in a mournful
tone, “that I shall always possess the kind
regard of the friends you have named. This
hope, indeed, is and ever must be the only
solace of my isolated, and, in all other respects,
hopeless existence!”</p>

<p>“Don’t speak that way, Edmund, you make
me quite melancholy!” said Frances, the tears
starting into her eyes, as she held out her
hand, which Edmund snatched and kissed.</p>

<p>“You <em>hope</em>!” said Julia, in a tremulous tone,
in which was something of reproach. She
looked up for a moment as she spoke, and Edmund
saw the glistening of tears in her eyes also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am sure,” he said, “of every thing that
is noble, every thing that is generous, every
thing that is kind.”—“That last word, Edmund,”
said Julia, interrupting him, “is more
like the language of the friend you ought to
feel yourself among us.”</p>

<p>“Besides,” said Frances, continuing the
former part of the subject, “grandmamma
and Mr. Jackson, you know, think it quite
certain that you are the son of a noble family.”</p>

<p>“Still, all is mystery!” he replied, mournfully,
as his thoughts reverted to the disgraceful
possibility which had of late haunted
his imagination, that of his being yet proved
the child of criminal, though, perhaps of titled
parents. “In short,” he continued, “a
being, such as I am, must drag out existence,
a solitary wanderer, unconnected with any,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
but by the ties of charity, of compassion.”
After a pause, which neither of the sisters
had voice to interrupt, he re-commenced—</p>

<p>“Duty, Frances, must soon again call me
from the too happy dream I have lately enjoyed.
Sometimes, indeed, in an hour of peace, I may,
I shall, return to happy, happy Lodore, the dear
paradise of my childhood; and from the generous
friendship there granted me, derive
gleams of felicity! snatches of a joy that will
render the rest of life, perhaps, more dark.”
He was silent a few seconds, then added,
“Yet so precious will such moments ever be
to me, that I shall hold them cheaply purchased
by the dreary wretchedness that must precede
and follow them!” Julia’s tears flowed
silently. Frances’s too, were again starting
into her eyes. “Nay, Edmund,” said the
latter, “there is something more than usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
in the matter! this love, this First Love that
you speak of so feelingly, I fear is a serious
business after all! for you never were in love
before, I suppose. But, indeed, you need not
grieve so much; for I know—that is—at least—I
have no right, perhaps, to betray such a
trust—but still—I am perfectly certain that—that
you will not be refused.”</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake what are you talking
of, Frances?” exclaimed Edmund, colouring
excessively, while Julia turned deadly pale.</p>

<p>“I am saying,” replied Frances, “that I
am sure, Lady Susan will not refuse you: she
thinks you—so——”</p>

<p>“Lady Susan!” repeated Edmund, in a
voice of disappointment. “She certainly
never will, Frances,” he added, “for I shall
never have the folly, or the presumption, to
put it in her power to do so. You know I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
have just explained to you that I can never
marry—at least—But I may say never; for it
would indeed be wildly romantic to hope that
I ever shall be enabled, even to seek to do so,
consistently with honour, and my own—wishes!
the word is too inadequate. And were I, by
the most unlooked-for circumstances, placed at
liberty—am I to—to have—the vanity to—But
you are leading me on to speak too much
of myself, Frances; which is always, you
know, a dangerous, as well as an unbecoming
topic.” He ceased, and all three walked on
for a time in silence. At length Julia said, in
a low tone—</p>

<p>“Why should it grieve you so much, Edmund,
not to—to marry? I don’t think there
is any occasion for every one to be married!
Now, I—for one—never intend to marry.”
Edmund started, and looked round.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>“You, Julia!” he said. “Yes,” she continued,
dropping her eyelids, “I am very
happy,” and here a sigh contradicted her assertion,
“loving the friends I have loved all my
life——” “All your long, long life!” ejaculated
Edmund, with a smile and a sigh. “And
I cannot imagine,” continued Julia, “beginning
now to love a stranger; or suppose any
thing so absurd as the possibility of setting up
a new image in my heart, to be worshipped
above all that have hitherto inhabited there!
Oh no! that, indeed, can never be.”</p>

<p>“So,” interrupted Frances, laughing, “we
are to understand that there is an old <em>image</em>
set up there already! (a first love, I suppose,
as Edmund calls it.) Is it then his lordship?
or our amiable and interesting cousin? It
would indeed be a charity to love him, for I
am sure no one else does.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh! you know Frances, I—don’t mean—I
mean, one’s own friends,” said Julia. “Now
ask yourself: could you ever love a stranger,
as you love those you have loved all your life?
As you love me for instance?”</p>

<p>“A stranger,” said Frances, considering,
“no, certainly, not while the stranger continued
to be a stranger.”</p>

<p>“Well Henry, you know, is no stranger, so
one of my guesses may be right, or perhaps
you like Edmund better—I am sure I do.”</p>

<p>Edmund had remained perfectly silent; for
a few seconds, he had actually been stunned by
the extacy of an irresistible conviction that
Julia was saying, as plainly as words could
express it, that she loved him, and that she
never would or could love any one else! But,
on her appeal to Frances in reply to the interruption
of the latter, his short lived transport<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
faded. “She alludes to the gentle ties of
relationship,” said he to himself, “and having
known no feeling but that of calm and gradually
formed affection, she cannot even imagine any
other.” A momentary pang indeed shot across
his heart, as Frances alluded to Henry; for
Julia might have loved him all her life, if she
loved him at all; but he was not, as Frances
observed, a character very likely to inspire
love. Then her manner, the expression of her
eyes, the tones of her voice; how different,
when she addressed himself, from what they
were when addressing her cousin! This was,
however, a subject not to be too closely examined,
though it served for the present to
banish all painful thoughts respecting Henry.</p>

<p>“They talk, you know,” said Frances, “of
love at first sight!” “Oh!” replied Julia,
“such people must either have no real friends,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and therefore no real affections, or be, themselves,
incapable of feeling a real attachment!”</p>

<p>“What do you call a real attachment?”
asked Frances. “Why, one founded on—on—having
all one’s life known, that the—friend—one
loves unites every quality that is noble
and estimable, not only in one’s own opinion,”
replied Julia, blushing deeper and deeper at
each word, “but in that of those, whose
judgment one respects, with all that is gentle,
kind, and amiable towards oneself!” Edmund
felt an almost irresistible desire to press her
hand as she said this, nor could he be quite
certain that he did not do so. “It was Mr.
Jackson,” she added, in a hurried manner,
“that was explaining the subject the other
day. He said, you know, Frances, that it was
because we are formed to find perfect happiness
hereafter in loving absolute perfection, that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
experience so much delight in attaching ourselves,
in this life, to what, on earth, comes
nearest to perfection! And what can we know
of the perfections of a stranger?”</p>

<p>“Why, not till we discover them,” replied
Frances, “but then, should they prove greater
than those of our older acquaintances, by your
own argument of loving best what comes nearest
to perfection, the stranger must deserve
and obtain our preference.”</p>

<p>“Oh! impossible!” exclaimed Julia.</p>

<p>“What is impossible?” asked Frances.
Julia made no answer, and Frances, after a
moment or two of silence, enquired of Edmund,
if the Lancer whom they had observed
driving his curricle round the lake yesterday
evening, were the same they had seen at the
Regatta. Edmund looked in her face without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
meaning or reply. His thoughts had been too
differently employed to be so easily brought to
bear on the identity of a Lancer. “You see,”
said Frances, “he is thinking of his First Love.
We ought not to tease him with questions on
less interesting subjects. I have been considering
about it, Edmund,” she continued,
“and I cannot see what harm it would be for
you to be married to Lady Susan, when it
would make you both happy.”</p>

<p>“Lady Susan!” repeated Edmund, “I am
not thinking about Lady Susan, I assure you,
Frances!”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said a soft voice from behind,
followed by immoderate laughter from several
persons. Our trio looked round, and beheld
Lady Susan herself, accompanied by Lord
Borrowdale, Lord Morven, and Henry. “We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
have caught the gallant Captain speaking of
your Ladyship at least,” observed Lord Borrowdale.</p>

<p>“Which, in my opinion, argues thinking,”
added Henry.</p>

<p>Edmund, not knowing well how to get out
of the scrape, joined the laugh, and said, he
believed he must plead guilty—of what, he left
it to the imagination of his accusers to determine.</p>

<p>Lady Susan seemed to think it was of being
in love, and that with herself; for she smiled,
addressed our hero frequently, and was particularly
obliging to him all the morning.
Lord Morven, who did not seem much to relish
the scene, asked, without addressing any
one in particular, who that dashing fellow was
who drove along the margin of the lake yesterday
evening as they were boating. “The same,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
answered Lord Borrowdale, “who made himself
so conspicuous during the regatta, splashing
through the crowd in his curricle.”</p>

<p>“I am aware of that,” rejoined Lord Morven,
“but I mean to enquire if any one knows
who the young man is?”</p>

<p>“That no one I believe can make out. The
name is Beaumont; but he has not brought
any introductions, and has, I understand, declined
the acquaintance of some persons who,
taking it for granted that he was of the noble
family of that name, wished to call on him.”</p>

<p>“He is not then, it would seem, very consistent,”
said Henry, “for he literally scraped
an acquaintance the other day with such a
fellow as Lawson, (my aunt’s man of business,)
for the express purpose of asking to be
introduced at Lodore House.”</p>

<p>“He shows his good taste,” said Lord Borrowdale,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
with an appropriate glance towards
the group of ladies.</p>

<p>“He appears,” observed Lord Morven, “to
have a tolerable taste in most things: his
horses are beautiful animals, and his dogs the
finest I have seen!”</p>

<p>“Is he not rather pleasing-looking himself
too?” asked Frances; “I thought so, as well
as one could see passing. Did not you think
so, Lady Susan?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I did not look at him,” replied her
ladyship, glancing at Edmund. “So,” said
Henry, with a sneer, “the fellow drives about
to some purpose it would seem.” “To a
most enviable one, certainly!” remarked the
compliment-loving Lord of Borrowdale.</p>

<p>“Pray, can any one tell what brought him
into this neighbourhood?” asked Lord Morven.
“They were obliged,” answered Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Borrowdale, “to send from Whitehaven to
Carlisle for military, to quell a very serious
riot of colliers, headed too, it seems, by one
of the fair sex, who, I understand, leads her
party in fashion of an equestrian amazon, and
who had, they say, proceeded in triumph
through every street in Whitehaven, terrified
the poor quiet magistrates, overturned the
carts of potatoes going down to the shipping
for exportation, and, in short, lorded it over
the whole population till the arrival of the
dragoons.”</p>

<p>“How very well he plays the flute!” said
Frances.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Henry, “and what good care
he took to keep his boat within hearing of our
party, these several evenings on the lake.”</p>

<p>“I dare say it was quite by accident,” rejoined
Frances; “and how picturesque the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
effect was,” she continued, turning to Lady
Susan, “of the little skiff with its one white
sail, appearing and disappearing round points
of rock; the one reclining figure playing on
the flute, the two dogs seated, one on each
side, listening with profound attention, till at
some dying cadence, pointing their noses upward,
they would utter a long and piteous
wail! while the rapt musician himself seemed
unconscious not only of their wild accompaniment,
and that of all the echoes far
and near, but even of his own performance.”</p>

<p>“He thought himself a perfect hero of romance,
I have no doubt,” replied her ladyship.</p>

<p>“Well!” cried Frances, “I do not think
there was any appearance of affectation about
him.”</p>

<p>“Whoever he is,” rejoined Henry, “he had
better not wander about these woods in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
long feathers, or I shall be apt to shoot him in
mistake for a pheasant.”</p>

<p>“Henry, you had better take care what you
do!” said Frances. “You are much too fond,
let me tell you, of killing of every kind.”</p>

<p>“Talking of shooting, what have you done
with that fine setter of yours, St. Aubin?”
asked Lord Morven.</p>

<p>“Shot him!”—“Why, for heaven’s sake?”</p>

<p>“The rascal leaped up on me with his dirty
feet, after I was dressed for dinner, the other
day.” “Shame! shame! Henry!” exclaimed
both the sisters, at the same moment. “Too
bad, faith,” cried the gentlemen.</p>

<p>Frances began to tell Henry that nobody
would ever love him, he was so wicked. He
affected to laugh, and whispered Julia as he
passed, loud enough, however, for Edmund,
who was on the other side, to hear. “What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
do <em>you</em> say to that, Julia?” At the same
time, accompanying his words with an insidious
look of tender, confiding enquiry. She
was astonished, but had not presence of mind
to reply: and even Edmund, at the time, only
thought Henry impertinent. The party had
now arrived in front of the house.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> all were taking their places at the
breakfast table, Lady Susan was so obliging in
making room for every one, that at last she
found herself seated next to our hero. But,
alas! Julia was on his other side. To do him
justice, however, he helped her ladyship abundantly,
too abundantly indeed to many things
she did not want: he even had the unparalleled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
generosity to offer her, and that with a sudden
start of recollection, his cup of tea when she
had one of her own; he also turned and begged
her pardon, more than once, when it was not
to him she had addressed herself.</p>

<p>“You see,” whispered Lord Borrowdale,
who, for lack of room near Julia, had seated
himself on the other side of Lady Susan,
“poor Montgomery is so bewildered by the
radiance of your ladyship’s smiles, that he actually
does not know what he is doing.”</p>

<p>Lady Susan sighed and smiled, and tried to
be of his lordship’s opinion. The following
plan, which had been in agitation ever since
the arrival of the Arandales at Lodore House,
was now finally arranged. In short, Mrs. Montgomery,
after many objections, at length consented
to her grand-daughters accompanying
their uncle’s family, back to Ayrshire, for about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
a month. Captain Montgomery, and Mr. St.
Aubin were invited to join the party. The
Euphrasia being still in dock, our hero quickly
assented to a proposal, by which he was to
enjoy a continuance of Julia’s society.</p>

<p>“Julia!” exclaimed Frances, on receiving
a message from a servant, “our poor
little friend, Gotterimo! Oh, may we have him
in, grandmamma? It will be so amusing!” “And
I dare say every body will buy something from
him,” added Julia.</p>

<p>“He is, I believe, a deserving poor creature,”
said Mrs. Montgomery. “Shall we
gratify the girls, and admit him?” she added,
turning to Lady Arandale.</p>

<p>Lady Arandale, of course, assented, and orders
were given accordingly. A young man,
of a neat diminutive figure, now entered. His
eyes sparkled with hope at the sight of so large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
a company; while, at the same time, a kind of
bashfulness flushed his cheek and flurried his
manner. The girls saw this, and felt for him.</p>

<p>“Here, will you open the boxes on this table,
Mr. Gotterimo?” said Julia; and while he was
doing so, she observed, that when the first
flush, called up by his entrance, went down, the
poor creature’s countenance assumed an anxious
and saddened expression.</p>

<p>“I hope,” she added, “you had good success
in Bath?” “Yes, madam,” he answered,
with some hesitation; then added, “it was first
year, madam—every ting must have begin,
madam.” This led to further enquiries, and a
dismal tale of having been robbed by his partner,
of the savings of his whole life.</p>

<p>Our breakfast party felt much commiseration
for poor Gotterimo; and commenced
making purchases as a means of affording, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
least, temporary assistance. The sale of his
goods raised the spirits of our poor little
friend, who soon became all activity in displaying,
and eloquence in recommending each
shining article in his sparkling collection. A
chain was admired by Edmund for its resemblance
to a cable, and was purchased by Julia.
Lord Arandale’s eye accidentally fell on a
musical box. Gotterimo set the air playing
immediately.</p>

<p>“Is it not rather slow in the time?” said
the Earl.</p>

<p>“Oh, de slow time, it do make listen!”</p>

<p>“I should prefer something less dismal,”
said his lordship.</p>

<p>“So ’tis, sir! De quick time, it do make
dance!” and, while he spoke, with nimble
fingers he was winding up a curious seal which
now began to execute a more lively air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is pretty!” said the Earl. Gotterimo
proffered the seal to his lordship.</p>

<p>“The articulation of the box is superior,”
observed Lady Susan.</p>

<p>“Dis be more superior,” cried Gotterimo,
presenting the box to her ladyship. “The
seal is the prettier thing,” persisted Lord
Arandale. “If you vil please, sir, bote be de
best,” pursued Gotterimo, offering both. Here
every one laughed. The little man looked
round him enquiringly, then, rallying, said—“So
’tis, sir, de seal be de best beautiful! de
box be de best music!” and he added, smiling
sheepishly, “every ting be de best fen it
bring Gotterimo de money!” This was logic
not to be resisted, and the Earl took both, together
with watches, seals, and chains, for
three or four absent nephews; while Lady
Arandale selected handsome presents for as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
many absent nieces. Thus went on a brisk
sale of poor Gotterimo’s goods, when Mrs.
Montgomery, happening to cast her eye over
the contents of one of the jewel boxes, which
lay open, her attention was fixed by a curious
mosaic ring: she caught it up and examined
it with a much deeper interest than it seemed
to merit. Gotterimo, believing she was admiring
the workmanship of the article, silently
undid the clasps of a small morocco case, and
placed it open before her. It contained the
set of mosaics to which the ring belonged:
her countenance changed; and Julia remarked
that movement of her head which always indicated
strong emotion. Mrs. Montgomery
turned the centre medallion. On the back part
of the gold rim was engraved Maria, her sister’s
name, and the mark by which they used
to distinguish between their necklaces. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
turned deadly pale, and was only prevented
sinking to the ground by the united support
of Julia, Edmund, and Frances.</p>

<p>The moment Mrs. Montgomery recovered, she
called for Gotterimo, and enquired, anxiously,
where, when, and how those ornaments had come
into his possession. “Dem be second hand,
Madam,” he replied; “I have buy dem of a
gentleman in London.” The name Gotterimo
could not immediately call to mind. He had
seen the person in question but once. In reply
to the question of what sort of looking gentleman
the person was, he said, “he vos tall and
good look; look angry fen he no please, and
have de loud voice.” Our little jeweller, however,
offered to make “enquiry” of a friend
of his, to whom, he said, “de same gentleman
have sell de grand old plate, and de great many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
picture, and de big box of de old fassion
moneys.” The purchase of the necklace had
been lately made; but all that Gotterimo knew
further of the person who had sold it to him
was, “that he have rob and cheat so many
tradge people; and have hire de big house in
⸺ Place, in London, to make dem tink him
grand gentleman;” but that when he, Gotterimo,
last left town, “de house vas empty,
vid de bill ‘To Let, Furnish,’ on de vindow.”
All now remembered to have read a recent account
in the papers of the said swindler and
his associates, with their assumed names.</p>

<p>The mosaics were purchased, and Gotterimo,
after receiving considerable charitable donations,
dismissed; while Mrs. Montgomery’s
agitation of spirits was, at length, in some
degree composed, by Mr. Jackson’s reminding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
her that the necklace must have been parted
with many years ago, by those of whom
she thought; and that, its having since passed
into the hands of a knot of swindlers, was by
no means a remarkable circumstance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">“Can</span> that noise be the bagpipes?” said
Frances to Julia, trying to look from an upper
window in one of the turrets of Arandale Castle.
But no object immediately near the building
could be discerned from windows situated
as were those of this apartment. The more
removed prospect, however, was rich and magnificent.
Woods, which seemed interminable,
every where met the eye; with, here and there,
an opening among their ranges, displaying a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
grassy avenue which ran along till lost again
in the far perspective of grove meeting grove.
In some of those avenues stood herds of deer,
looking around them with an air of the most
stately security; in others, even hares and
rabbits were sometimes seen to venture from
under cover, cross a path, and disappear again,
whilst innumerable cawing rooks, continually
passing and repassing each other’s heavy flight,
hovered over all the summits of the trees; and
in their branches sat gay plumed peacocks,
uttering, from time to time, their wild cry.
To complete the picture, one of the grassy
avenues already described, terminated in a
smooth, still sheet of water, an arm of which
was crossed, at a considerable height, by a
light bridge of iron work; while, on its glassy
surface, sailed two snow white swans, the sole
visible inhabitants of this their watery realm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is the bagpipes, my Lady,” said Alice
Smyth, “the housekeeper told me to tell your
ladyships, that that was the way your ladyships
would know when breakfast was ready.
The old piper walks up and down under the
windows, playing highland tunes all the time
of breakfast, which my Lady Arandale makes
herself every day at ten o’clock, and never
waits for any body, but sends all away again at
eleven, let who will or will not come down.”</p>

<p>“And does her ladyship make no allowance
for the first morning after a long journey?”
said Frances, (for they had all arrived
at Arandale but the night before); “I
declare my limbs are quite stiff. But we
had better make haste, or, by Alice’s account,
we shall have no breakfast,” she continued,
taking her sister’s arm.</p>

<p>As they passed along the galleries above,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and across the halls below, numerous domestics
pointed out, in silence, the way to the breakfast
room. On their entrance, a general move
took place among the gentlemen, though only
the family party, each offered or pointed out
a seat or seats. It so happened, that Julia
took one offered by Edmund, who seated himself
beside her, and began silently placing within
her reach, every thing she could possibly
want.</p>

<p>Lady Arandale sat at the head, Lady Susan
at the foot of a long table; the one filled tea,
the other coffee; and, in the intermediate
space appeared the usual hot rolls, toast,
eggs, etc. of an English breakfast, reinforced
by the Scottish addition of crisp leaves
of oaten cake, thin as writing paper, together
with comfits, marmalade, and all sorts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
sweetmeats. Lord Morven presided at a side
table, abundantly covered with savoury pies,
cold meats, and dried fish; while Lord Arandale
seemed to have the sole possession of a
third and lesser one, where he alone was eating
of a certain preparation of oatmeal, called in
Scotland, porridge.</p>

<p>“You have quite forsaken your post, Captain
Montgomery,” said Lady Susan. “I
beg a thousand pardons,” exclaimed Edmund,
starting up, “I thought I had filled all
the cups.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” replied her ladyship, in a tone
of much pique, “Oh, pray be seated,” then,
affecting a laugh, and closing her eyelids quickly
once or twice to disperse a tear that might
else have betrayed her mortification, she added,
“you did not then, let me inform you, fill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
even one. Nay, do pray sit down!” she continued,
as Edmund made another attempt to
rise, “I have completed my task with very
little fatigue, I assure you, though you were
so much shocked at the idea of my undertaking
it.” Lord Morven, a wing of pigeon suspended
on his fork, looked round at his sister
with a broad and silent stare. She blushed,
and addressed, successively, Henry, Frances,
and Colonel Morven, without waiting for an
answer from any of them. Edmund coloured,
and Julia, who had neither been addressed
nor accused, but by her own conscience, coloured
also.</p>

<p>Lord Arandale, having dispatched his first
course, joined the general table to finish his
repast with some of the good things it afforded.
Plans of amusement for the day now
became the general topic; Julia and Frances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
begged that they might be permitted to explore
some of the beauties of the grounds, which,
from their windows, promised so much. Lady
Susan proposed a visit to her cottage; it was
one of those imitations of a real rustic habitation,
which, situated in some delightful retirement
in the midst of extensive pleasure
grounds, were the fashionable playthings of
the great young ladies of the day. A spinning
wheel was always a part of the furniture, and
a proficiency in its use a necessary accomplishment
to ladies possessing these rural boudoirs.
Her ladyship’s proposition seemed agreeable
to every one; particularly as the walk to the
cottage led through much of what was most
interesting in the grounds. Immediately after
breakfast, therefore, the whole party assembled
in front of the castle to commence their ramble.</p>

<p>Lord Arandale saying that he would show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Julia the way, drew her arm over his; Lord
Morven offered his to Frances; Henry joined
Colonel Morven; Lady Susan walked alone;
and Edmund, who on first setting out had intended
to walk at the other side of Julia, felt
himself obliged, in common politeness, to step
forward and join the lady who had no companion.
He did not, however, intend to offer his
arm, as he meant to avail himself of the first
favourable opportunity for desertion. But her
ladyship struck her foot against the stump of
a flower root, then limped a step or two, and
next came in contact with a loose stone: in
short he found it impossible to evince a suitable
concern for such accidents, without saying
something about an arm. Lady Susan accordingly
took his arm; laughed at her own giddiness,
confessed her want of a guide;
“Though,” she added, “here I ought rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
to be yours, instead of making myself so troublesome.”
Edmund said, very coolly, as he
thought, that he was happy in being useful;
reproached her ladyship in due form for misnaming
the pleasure of being so, a trouble;
and proceeded to hope that she had not suffered
materially from his negligence, in the first instance.
There was something so soothing, so
persuasive in Edmund’s manner and voice, at
all times, that common politeness from him,
possessed an almost dangerous charm; and
her ladyship was willing to be deceived.</p>

<p>Such a manner must be the result of suppressed
feeling, thought Lady Susan; but she remembered
the coffee: yet, might not even that, she
asked herself, be one of the strange inconsistencies
of love. Her spirits began to rise; and
her good humour, never long absent, returned.
She introduced sentimental subjects, and frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
spoke in so low a tone, that Edmund
was obliged to stoop towards her to gather the
meaning of what she said; so that to those
who walked behind them, they appeared to be
engaged in very earnest, and very interesting
conversation. They turned off into a narrower
walk; and the next time Edmund looked
over his shoulder, which he did rather oftener
than Lady Susan liked, not one of the
rest of the party was any where to be seen.</p>

<p>“Your ladyship should certainly know the
way here,” said Edmund, hesitating, and
slackening his pace; “but we have either left
them all very far behind, or taken a wrong
path.” “This is the prettiest way to my cottage,”
said her ladyship, “to which they will
all certainly bend their steps, by whatever walk
they may have gone round.” Accordingly,
our advance couple proceeded onward uninterrupted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
through delightful solitudes. Her
ladyship grew more and more romantic; many
of her opinions, many of her very expressions
were in perfect unison with the secret sentiments
of Edmund; though those sentiments
had, it must be confessed another object; Edmund’s
replies, therefore, were frequently bursts
of feeling suddenly checked; he was often
silent, and sometimes sighed.</p>

<p>Lady Susan no longer doubted. There was
a struggle in her bosom between natural
modesty and a generous wish to reward the
attachment of one, who was kept silent by
honourable and manly motives.</p>

<p>By this time they reached the cottage. It
was all that was rural; thatched, of course,
and overgrown with jessamine, honeysuckle,
and ever blowing roses. Buried in the deep
woods that surrounded the castle, it had a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
paled in garden and a small space of green,
clear in its front; and, at the foot of the green,
ran a little rivulet with a plank thrown over it,
to form a rustic bridge. Tamed pheasants strayed
about instead of barn-door fowl, a kid was
tied to the paling, and a sheep with two lambs
fed on the little plot of grass before the door.</p>

<p>Her ladyship having, with Edmund’s assistance,
crossed the plank, caressed each of her
favourites as she passed them, and, leading the
way through the little garden, opened the latch
of the cottage. All within was perfect rusticity:
the furniture consisted of a small dresser
with a few delf plates, a corner cupboard with
some common looking cups and saucers, a deal
table, a few wooden chairs, a low three legged
stool, a spinning wheel, a kettle and some dried
herbs suspended from the ceiling, some bright
tin utensils arranged on nails against the wall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
over the chimney-piece, and a small looking-glass
hung at the side of the latticed window.</p>

<p>Lady Susan became silent and absent; went
to various repositories of grain and fed each of
her pets; Edmund, of course, assisting. When
she had finished, she seated herself on the three-legged
stool, and began to spin with great
assiduity and quite a practised hand. Edmund,
whom she had requested to take a
chair beside her, sat for some time in silent
admiration of her performance. Suddenly, she
lifted the toe of the foot that had kept the
wheel in motion, and suspended the little white
hand over the fore finger, of which the thread
had been passing. “This spot, you see, Captain
Montgomery,” she said, “is my plaything;
yet, how happy might people be whose
all it was!”</p>

<p>“Certainly!” he replied with much energy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
instantly making Julia in imagination its mistress,
and himself her partner for life: “Here
is all that unsophisticated nature calls for; and,
in the society of an object beloved, how seldom
would the outer world be remembered!”</p>

<p>Her ladyship blushed and sighed; but Edmund’s
thoughts were full of another image,
and the blush and the sigh, which else might
have spoken volumes, were unnoticed by him.
A considerable pause ensued. “It certainly
is madness,” said Lady Susan at length in a
low voice, and with some hesitation, “It certainly—is—madness,
to sacrifice realities to
opinions, and those opinions not our own!”</p>

<p>“Oh, most assuredly!” replied Edmund,
“when such is the case; but when our own
opinions, our own sense of all that is honourable,
just, grateful, are in direct opposition to
our own feelings of all that:”—he recollected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
himself, broke off suddenly, and coloured: not
that he apprehended being misunderstood; he
rather dreaded that he was too well understood,
and conscious that he thought of Julia
while he spoke, feared he had inadvertently
betrayed sentiments it was so incumbent upon
him to conceal. “Yet—yet—” said her ladyship,
“if—if the object—of an attachment so
tender, yet governed so entirely by honourable
principles, is willing to wave imaginary, in favour
of real superiority?”—and she held out
her hand.</p>

<p>Edmund first stared at the hand; then,
scarcely conscious of the mechanical movement,
took it in his. “For heaven’s sake, what
do you mean, Lady Susan?” he exclaimed,
changing colour twenty times in a minute;
for, still possessed with the one idea, and
too little of a coxcomb to be ready to believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
her ladyship seriously attached to him because
idle people had jested on the subject, the
thought crossed his mind in the confusion of the
moment, that Lady Susan must be in the confidence
of her cousin, and must be expressing
her belief that Julia returned his attachment.</p>

<p>Lady Susan spoke again,—“It would be mere
affectation in me, Captain Montgomery,” she
said, “to pretend blindness to the state of
your feelings, and I respect the motives that
have prevented their open declaration—” Her
ladyship looked down, paused, and trembled
excessively. Voices were heard without. The
party passed the paling gate, and moved along
the little walk of the garden. Lady Susan
looked in alarm towards the door, coloured
very deeply, and said, in a hurried tone, and
with a kind of smile that struggled with a few
tears of mingled pleasure and shame, “It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
rather hard, that I should have it to say, half
unasked after all; yet, in favour of your motives,
which I honour, I will say it—I am
yours!” At this moment, the whole party
flocked in, and filled up the little cottage room.
Lady Susan snatched away her hand, which
Edmund had been too much puzzled to resign,
and resumed her spinning in a state of overwhelming
confusion. Edmund stood rooted
to the spot, looking and feeling, if possible,
still more confounded; his colour mounting
gradually as his perception of the truth cleared
up, while his countenance became filled with
expressions the most inexplicable!</p>

<p>Lord Arandale, fortunately for Lady Susan,
was too busy speaking to Julia about some of the
beauties of the grounds to observe his daughter.
But he addressed an ear that heard little of
what he said. Julia, during the walk, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
been wishing that Edmund would join them.
She had observed him when going on before
the rest of the party with Lady Susan, and,
seemingly engaged in a conversation so earnest;
and she had, even then, felt a slight unacknowledged
sensation of uneasiness.</p>

<p>On entering the cottage, the first object that
met her eye was the eye of Edmund. For the first
time its expression did not banish every shadow
from her thoughts, did not bring sunshine
to her heart. It had never before had a meaning
that she had not felt, at least, (if not exactly
understood,) and felt with a too dangerous
consciousness of delight; now his eye
wandered from hers without an answering look.
Lady Susan, too, how extraordinary was her
expression! Julia became in one moment,
though she had no time to ask herself why,
miserable! entirely miserable! It was a kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
of wretchedness, too, that she had never before
even imagined. It puzzled—it alarmed her.
A hopelessness came over her heart, that in all
her grievings over the thoughts of Edmund’s
going away, she had never known. Though she
had never formed any other plan but that Edmund
was to be her friend, her brother, she his
friend, his sister; this had all been, while the
bare idea of ever being other than the first in
his affections, had not once presented itself to
her imagination as even possible; but now, unaccustomed
as she was to analyze subjects of
love and marriage, there was something in the
circumstances of the two conscious beings before
her, which seemed obviously to set up a
living, breathing object between herself and
Edmund. Why such should be any obstacle
to brotherly and sisterly regard still subsisting
between them, she did not particularly enquire;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
yet all the stores of love and happiness that
she had been collecting from infancy, seemed
now to have been swept away in one single
moment. She continued, however, to hang on
the arm of Lord Arandale, and to answer any
direct questions put to her as well as she could.
After examining and admiring the cottage and
grounds, the party at length returned to the
gravel-sweep before the castle.</p>

<p>A curricle, with a gentleman driving, and a
lady seated beside him, was now seen approaching.
“Here is Lady Morven at last,” said
Lord Arandale, letting go Julia’s arm, and advancing
towards the new arrival.</p>

<p>“Matilda, I declare!” cried Lady Susan,
hastening forward with her brother, who, on
their return from the cottage, had, in a very
marked manner, insisted on her taking his second
arm. Edmund, who had walked in silence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
on the other side of Julia, pondering partly on
her altered manner, and partly on his own late
adventure; when Lord Arandale withdrew his
support, took up her hand, softly, and drew it
over his arm; bending forward, at the same
time, as if anxious to catch a view of her
countenance. She kept her head, however,
carefully turned in a contrary direction, and
the moment they reached the steps, without
speaking or looking round, withdrew her arm,
glided away, and hurried up to her own room.
Yet, such is the weakness of the heart that
loves, that she had felt less unhappy during the
few seconds her arm had rested on that of
Edmund.</p>

<p>Julia’s conduct and feelings on this occasion,
were certainly very foolish, but it
must be remembered that she was scarcely
eighteen; that she had been brought up in perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
seclusion, a seclusion too of sentiment,
where, from five years old, she had never seen,
or even heard any thing of life, but within the
one domestic circle, in which all that was
thought of, was tender mourning for the one
that was lost, and tender cherishing of the few
that were left. It is not then surprising that
those few, and the first place in their hearts,
should be romantically valued by one whose
opening mind had thus, in every stage of its
developement, been strongly impressed with
the one idea, that all the rest of the world must
be for ever strangers to her, in comparison of
those who had, in this exclusive manner, possessed
her earliest affections. And when, in
addition to all this, the spell of a <em>first love</em>
had fallen on a heart so prepared, could much
philosophy be expected?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> party we left at the door, reinforced by
a number of newly arrived nephews and nieces
of my lord’s and my lady’s, were by this time
entering the great drawing-room, at the further
end of which Lady Arandale was seated on a
sofa, arranging, on a table before her, the presents
she had brought for her nieces. From
out of the entering group, one lady, whose
precedence seemed to be undisputed, came forward
towards Lady Arandale. It was Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Morven. She was very tall, and very slight
with long thin limbs, a small head, a little round
face, deeply pockmarked, small grey eyes,
scarcely any nose, and a small mouth without
any lips. She was highly rouged, and dressed
both fashionably and extravagantly; and her
figure, though totally without form, had an
air of grace as well as of elegance. The first
salutation over, she flung herself on a sofa
opposite to that occupied by Lady Arandale.</p>

<p>“And pray, Matilda, my dear,” said the
last named lady, “why did you not come to
Lodore after all?”</p>

<p>“La! ma’am, I had nobody to drive me.”</p>

<p>“Had na’ ye, yier coachman, my dear?”</p>

<p>“You know, I can’t bear any body’s driving
but Graham’s; and the wretch thought fit to
fall out of his curricle the very day he was
coming over to take me: so there I have had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
him, with his arm in a sling, lounging about at
Morven Hall, ever since: quite a bore, I assure
you!”</p>

<p>“Your ladyship does me in-fi-nite honour!”
faintly drawled out Mr. Graham, from the
depths of a repose-chair, well furnished with
down pillows, in which he had established himself.
“Cruel—the distance,” he continued,
letting fall word after word, “which divides
me—from—so much goodness—Pray—Lady
Morven—are the cushions—on that—sofa—mul-ti-tudinous?”</p>

<p>“Yes, there are a good many,” replied her
ladyship, and as she spoke she made room for
him, adding, “had you not better come over?”</p>

<p>“I am meditating the exertion of a removal
shortly,” he rejoined, “but just—at present—it
is quite—impossible: I am—absolutely in—elysium—enjoying—the
very first sweets of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
attitude—the most deliciously easy, in which—I
had ever—the good fortune—to place myself.”</p>

<p>“And pray,” asked Lady Arandale, “was
this nursing of Mr. Graham’s wounds, a <i lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i>
business?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Lady Morven, “except a
parcel of the girls, you know,” (the girls were
all above twenty) “and that creature, Sir
Archibald Oswald, harmless as usual, though
more mad, I think, than ever!”</p>

<p>“Which is that, Graham or Lady Morven,
who does Sir Archibald Oswald the honour of
naming him?” demanded a voice, in the tones
of which a slight tincture of affectation was
blended with melancholy and melody. It
arose from a yet unseen personage, of whose
arrival no one seemed to be aware, and who,
reclining on a chaise-longue in the recess of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
distant window, was sheltered from observation
by a large circular stand of exotics. Lady
Morven started on her seat with a sort of rebound.
The young people smiled, and tittered
a little. Lord Arandale looked at them and
frowned.</p>

<p>“Are you there, my good friend?” he said,
going towards the reclining gentleman, who, at
his approach, slowly and reluctantly arose.</p>

<p>“Ye may weel ask whilk it was that spack,
Sir Archy,” observed Lady Arandale, who
prided herself on speaking broad Scotch. “It
is vara true, there is nae telling the voice o’ the
one, fra that o’ the other.”</p>

<p>“Why,” drawled Lady Morven, “I quite
admire Mr. Graham’s accent, and therefore I
make it a point to speak like him.”</p>

<p>“Your ladyship is too good!” articulated
the drowsy subject of this compliment. Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Archibald by this time stood quite erect, answering
some polite enquiries of Lord Arandale
and Lord Morven, who seemed desirous to
unite in shewing a peculiar degree of courtesy
to this guest. Edmund stood alone, observing
with much interest the appearance of Sir Archibald,
the peculiar and melancholy melody of
whose voice had first drawn his attention. His
figure was tall, well proportioned, and had an
air of dignity. He seemed little more than
fifty; but very grey for that age. His hair
was parted on the forehead, and fell on either
side of the face so long, and with so little regard
to present modes, as to resemble that of
one of the ancient bards. His countenance,
though its beauty was almost defaced by the
deepest furrows of affliction and premature old
age, still retained the outlines of fine features,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
to which the melancholy that predominated in
its expression, gave much interest.</p>

<p>Lord Arandale summoned Edmund by a
look, and presented him to Sir Archibald, saying,
“This gentleman, Sir Archibald, can talk
to you on your favourite subject, of naval affairs,
better than most people.” Edmund now
joined the group, and while taking a part in
the very incoherent conversation that was going
on, observed, with much compassion, that the
fire which awakened animation from time to
time, called into the eye of the evidently unfortunate
being before him, varied from wild to
gloomy, and from gloomy to wild, but never
once expressed pleasure; indeed it was when
he attempted to smile that the light was wildest:
and how instantaneously, how darkly did
the cloud that thus had opened but for a moment,
close again!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“What a wreck is there!” said Lord Arandale
to our hero, as Sir Archibald and Lord
Morven left the room together. Edmund looked
a sort of enquiry, which the Earl answered
thus: “Gambling, gambling it was which
ruined him, as it has done many others.—There
is a man who, twenty-five years since, possessed
a property of twelve thousand per annum,
in this county, where he was well known and
much respected by us all;—now he has not sixpence
in the world. He lives in the Isle of
Man; his poor wife is broken-hearted, they
say; and his boy is bringing up without education
or prospects. It was the birth of that
child to an inheritance of ruin, which, I believe,
unsettled poor Oswald’s mind. When he is
sane he remains on the island in the strictest
retirement; but, when he wanders in mind, he
wanders in body also, and throwing himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
into any fishing smack or boat that happens to
be on the coast, wherever he may chance to be
landed on the main land he makes his way to
this neighbourhood, visits the houses of those
with whom he used to associate in his days of
prosperity, seems unconscious that any change
has taken place, and wears, wherever he goes,
such clothes as are left for him in his room.
Sometimes he enters the house where he once
was master, fancies it still his home, and acts
the host with all the graceful politeness for
which he was once remarkable, treating the
family now residing there, and any company
they happen to have with them, as his guests.”</p>

<p>“He looks to great advantage when he is
here,” said Lady Morven, “Alfred’s clothes
fit him so well.”</p>

<p>“Did your ladyship ever happen to see
him at the Laird of Moorland’s?” enquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Mr. Graham, who had now got to the sofa on
which Lady Morven lolled; “the laird, you
know, is very short, and very fat, and you
never saw such a figure as Sir Archibald makes
in his clothes!”</p>

<p>“Misfortunes, even when they are, as in
this instance, the results of the sufferer’s own
imprudence, still are bad subjects for merriment,”
mournfully observed Lord Arandale,
to whom the attempt to cast ridicule on his
unhappy friend seemed very unwelcome.
“You see, Montgomery,” he continued, turning
to Edmund and leading him apart, “what
gambling will bring a man to! It was,” and
he lowered his voice and looked towards Henry
to see that he was not within hearing, “it was
that horrible St. Aubin, (that young fellow’s
father,) who ruined poor Oswald. I believe
too,” he added, “that Oswald was very sincerely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
attached to poor Maria before she made
the unfortunate choice she did; and that disappointment
had its share in throwing him
into bad habits.”</p>

<p>“What is the cause,” asked Edmund, “of
the interest Sir Archibald seems to take in the
Navy?”</p>

<p>“He did belong to the profession in very
early life,” replied his lordship, “and was
fond of it, I believe; but left it when his father
and elder brother died. In his lucid intervals,
I understand, he wishes very ardently to get
his boy afloat; but no one, you see, likes to
take charge of a lad so unfortunately situated.
It would be attended, too, with some share of
expense; for poor Oswald has not even the
means of fitting him out; and Lady Oswald’s
relatives, who are very powerful, have never
pardoned her the misfortunes she has brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
on herself; for Oswald was nearly a ruined
man when the marriage took place; she, however,
had been previously engaged and attached,
and would not break it off.”</p>

<p>Edmund was so forcibly struck by this melancholy
relation, that he made no immediate
reply. He thought of what he himself had
been when a boy; of what he might have been
at this day had no benevolent hand been
stretched forth in his behalf. His resolution
was taken, but he made no allusion to it at the
time, and retired to dress pondering the subject:
for the half hour bell was ringing, and
all the party dispersing on the same important
errand. Frances and Lady Susan, who had
all this time been busily engaged in a distant
window in seemingly very confidential conversation,
were the last to part.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Julia heard Frances approaching, she
was, for the first time in her life, guilty of
artifice; she snatched up a book, and appeared
to be busily engaged reading. Frances rang
the bell, then went towards a looking glass,
and began to take pins out of her dress.</p>

<p>“Do you know, Julia,” she said, “I think
that Edmund and Lady Susan will be married
after all!” Julia pretended not to hear, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
reality did not see, (correctly at least) for the
words on the open page before her seemed
quitting their ranks, and mingling in one disorderly
maze. This however was of little
importance, as she had held the book upside
down from the first.</p>

<p>“I can’t but think of all Edmund’s resolutions,”
pursued Frances, laughing, and continuing
the preparations for her toilet, without
noticing the effect of her information upon
Julia. The entrance of Alice here put an end
to the subject.</p>

<p>“What shall we wear to day, love?” asked
Frances.</p>

<p>“Wear——?” repeated her sister.</p>

<p>“Yes, what dress shall we wear?”</p>

<p>“Oh—whatever you like, love.”</p>

<p>“Bless me, my Lady!” cried Alice, “what
do you want of your nightcap?” Julia snatched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
off the half-arranged cap, and flung it on a
chair, colouring, and replying in evident confusion,
“I declare I forgot, I thought we were
going to bed.” Frances laughed so immoderately,
that it gave Julia time to recover. She
made a strong effort, aroused her faculties,
and, to a certain degree, composed herself.
The labours of the toilet completed, the sisters
descended; Lady Arandale was seated on
a sofa with Mrs. Morven, an elderly lady, the
wife of a brother of my Lord. Lady Morven
and Mr. Graham were lounging on an ottoman,
talking about nothing, and apparently fearful
of exhausting their slender stock of ideas by
any extravagant expenditure, seemed trying
which of them could articulate the slowest.
Henry was standing in a window, flirting with
no less than three of the Misses Morven. The
fourth Miss Morven was seated on a sofa with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
a Mr. Gordon; Edmund and Lady Susan
stood in a very distant window, in deep conversation;
and, in another and nearer window,
stood Lord Arandale, General Morven,
a brother of his lordship, Lord Morven, Colonel
Morven, and two Messrs. Morven, in
conversation with Sir Archibald Oswald. Julia
and Frances entered, and some family introductions
were made, during which, Sir Archibald
left the circle of gentlemen which had
surrounded him, approached the sisters, and
stood gazing at them.</p>

<p>“Poor Sir Archibald was always a great
admirer of beauty,” observed Lord Arandale,
aside to the General, “and still, I think, it
seems to possess a sort of soothing power over
his exasperated feelings.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said the General, “(though I
don’t think either of the girls like their aunt,)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
he may perceive that degree of family resemblance
in Julia, which has, sometimes, so
powerful an effect on the disordered imagination.”</p>

<p>“He was so young,” replied his lordship,
“that I should think he could scarcely remember
her.” “It was a boy’s love, certainly,”
said the General, “but it was, I believe, a <em>first
love</em>, which, they say, leaves an indelible impression.”
“It is fortunate that he does not
seem to perceive Henry’s terrific likeness to
his father,” observed the Earl. By this time,
Julia was seated, and Sir Archibald had taken a
footstool, placed it at her feet, and seated himself
upon it. He looked up mournfully in her
face for a few seconds; and then, to the surprise
of every one, commenced giving utterance to
a low murmuring sound, which gradually swelled
into the rich harmonies of a very old song,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
all the changes of which were performed with
the most perfect melody of voice, and to which
a pervading melancholy, diversified by occasional
starts of wildness, gave indescribable interest.
All became silent listeners: not a
whisper broke the spell; till the growl of the
gong was heard, then its roar, like that of
beasts of prey.</p>

<p>Sir Archibald ceased, listened, arose; and
without appearing aware of his own late performance,
offered his arm to Julia: and all this
with quite the air of a man of the world; his
manners, at the moment, were even tinctured
with that slight degree of affectation, which,
once was one of his youthful foibles; while they
bore no mark whatever of the deranged state of
his mind.</p>

<p>Lord Arandale handed down Mrs. Morven;
the General, Lady Arandale; Mr. Graham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Lady Morven; the Colonel, Frances; Henry
took two Misses Morven; Mr. Gordon, the
other two Misses Morven. Edmund next, led
Lady Susan from the recess of the window.
This last couple were first waited for at the
drawing-room door, and then followed to the
dining-room by Lord Morven, who seemed to
view his sisters’ flirtation with much more severity
of aspect, than he manifested towards
his wife’s.</p>

<p>Lady Susan did not smile once, in the whole
course of dinner; a thing never known before.</p>

<p>Edmund was silently and respectfully attentive
to her ladyship, but also grave. Julia
received, with absent passiveness, the politeness
of Sir Archibald, wondering the while,
why Lady Susan did not look happy! The rest
of the party were very gay.</p>

<p>During the dessert, Sir Archibald asked Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Arandale, in a careless manner, how the pretty
Mrs. Miller did. The Earl was at a stand for
a few moments; but, throwing his recollections
back some five and twenty years, he answered:
“well, I believe—a beautiful creature
she was,” he added.—“Was!” repeated Sir
Archibald; “no accident, I hope has befallen
the lady?” “Not any, to my knowledge,” replied
the Earl. Then addressing Mrs. Morven
aside, he added, “only, that the suns of
twenty or thirty summers have withered the
fresh bloom, and the snows of as many winters,
whitened the bright locks of pretty Mrs.
Miller; but poor Oswald, I see, is thinking of
our adventure with that fair dame, as of a business
of yesterday. How mysterious is the
power of association!” And the Earl smiled,
though with a mixture of melancholy, at his
own recollections. Mrs. Morven requested a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
translation of the smile. “Shall I tell that
good story, Oswald?” said Lord Arandale.
Sir Archibald had become absent again, and
replied only by a bow. Much curiosity, however,
being expressed by the ladies, to hear
what had been announced as a good story, the
Earl was prevailed on to commence the following
relation.</p>

<p>“Oswald and myself were a pair of wild
fellows, in those days,” he proceeded; “we
happened to be riding together one fine morning,
how long since I shall not say; when,
passing through the village of Irvine, we saw
seated in a window at work, but dressed gayly
enough, a very beautiful young woman, no
other than this said Mrs. Miller. We knew
not, of course, who the lady might be, so went
to a shop nearly opposite, to ask the question.
Here we learned that the fair object of our enquiries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
was the young wife of the old minister.
We drew off, and put our horses’ heads together,
to consult on the measures to be adopted
next.</p>

<p>“Old Miller, said I, will esteem it not only a
compliment, but an eternal obligation, if I call
on him; and I can take any friend with me,
you know, that I please. We rode to the door,
sent in our names, and were admitted into a
small, smoky, dirty parlour; the inside of
which I shall never forget. The perfumes of a
lately removed dinner, of which a certain fragrant
vegetable, and a no less odoriferous liquid,
had evidently formed component parts,
were overpowering; especially to people who
had been just galloping their horses over the
fresh heath of the open moorlands. The old
minister, in his worsted hose and red nightcap,
(but I shall not attempt to paint him,)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
met us, boo, booing, and returning thanks to
my lordship for the honour conferred on him
and his peur hoose, by my lordship’s visit;
and declaring, with another boo to Oswald,
that ony friend o’ my lordship mon be welcome.”</p>

<p>Lord Arandale could imitate the Scotch accent
very well, when giving humour to a droll
story. “‘Your daughter, I suppose, Mr. Miller,’
I said, bowing to the lady. ‘My wife—Maistriss
Miller—gin yier lordship has nay objection.’
‘You are a fortunate man, Mr.
Miller,’ I said; ‘such wives are not to be
had every day,’ and I bowed again to the lady,
who smiled. ‘Ye mauna pit nay sic notions
intil woman’s heade, my Lord,’ said Miller;
‘Meg kens vara weel hersel, that she could
niver heve evened hersel tle a Minister, gin
he hed been a young calant, at hed time tle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
look about him for a mair befitting spoose.—Bit
as a christian man, I ken ’at we awe come
o’ Adam and Eve; and se, Meg, if she behave
hersel, will di vara weel for me.’ Oswald,
mean while, was making some pretty side
speeches to Mrs. Miller; so that the old fellow,
beginning to perceive that our visit was to
his wife, not to himself, after fidgeting and
looking foolish for a few minutes, seemed
struck with a sudden thought, in pursuance of
which he played us such a trick, as never was,
I believe, practised before on two gay fellows
like ourselves.</p>

<p>“‘My Lord,’ he said, with mock solemnity,
‘this is just oor hoor for femily preyer, whilk
I niver defer for ony carnal interruption.—Yier
lordship, hooiver, will heve nay objection, tle
join yier voice tle oor devotions; as, truly, this
visit, marking yier personal respeck for yier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
minister, hath proven.’ So saying, and without
giving us time to take any measures of
self-defence, he fell on his knees and began to
pray aloud. The lady knelt down also, and,
faith, we were taken so by surprise, that if we
did not absolutely kneel, we stood with our
faces in our hats, resolving not to call again at
that hour. The prayer was unmercifully long;
extemporary, of course, and consisting chiefly
of earnest supplication for grace to withstand
all temptation to such errors as he thought fit,
in his christian charity, to suspect were, just
then, the besetting sins of his congregation.
What a cordial we found the air, even of the
street, when at last we got into it; which we
did the moment the amen had been pronounced.
In a day or two, however, we called at
quite a different hour; but had not been seated
many seconds, when the old fellow told us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
with a sly ironical smile, that we surely had
the gift o’ prophecy, for that we were just in
time again for his family prayer. Accordingly
he was about to kneel as before, but
this being rather too much of a good thing, we
made our escape, and gave up the acquaintance
both of Maistriss and Maister Miller. Take
notice, however, young men,” continued the
Earl, addressing himself particularly to his
family circle, “I do not mean to offer this
conduct of my own and my friends as an example
for your imitation; it was highly improper,
though in our own justification, I
must add, that we had no worse intention than
to frighten the old fellow a little, and excite
the vanity of his wife; as, what we, in our
wisdoms, considered a just penance for his having
helped himself to one so much too young
and too pretty for him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>During the comments which followed, Sir
Archibald caught the sound of Henry’s voice,
which had the exact tone of his father’s, particularly
in a laugh. He glanced his eye in
that direction, and now seemed to see young
St. Aubin for the first time, though he was
seated exactly opposite to him. Clouds gathered
on Oswald’s brow, and he directed across
the table looks so fierce and so portentous,
that the whole company became alarmed. The
ladies rose to retire, and Lord Arandale, during
the move which their exit occasioned, gave
Henry a hint to keep as much as possible out
of Sir Archibald’s view.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> it was still day-light some of the ladies
walked to the gardens, others strolled about
near the doors; Lady Susan disappeared without
speaking to any one; Frances went to seek
her; Julia flung herself on a sofa in the great
drawing-room, which she found quite deserted.
She lay so much absorbed by her own meditations,
as to be unconscious of the lapse of
time. It became quite dark. Every thing
was still about her. At length she heard a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
very soft step approaching through the ante-room,
and a figure in black appeared within
the door, which was half open. It held in its
hand a long white wand tipped with flame:
it glided on with a step, now that it was on the
deep Turkey carpet of the drawing-room, quite
noiseless: it touched branches and candelabras
with its magic wand, and left floods of
light behind it: it proceeded through the glass
doors of a green-house, at the further end of
this spacious apartment, and continued crowning
with radiance lustres that hung, at certain
intervals, over the centre walk, till the whole
long perspective became a dazzling maze of
real and reflected illumination. Julia’s eyes
admired and, mechanically, followed what they
beheld long before her comprehension was
aroused to any understanding of what was
going forward: at length she smiled as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
recollected that such had been her abstraction,
that, for the first few moments after the entrance
of the figure, she had viewed it and its
operations with as much of almost superstitious
astonishment as if she had never before
seen a decent old butler, who was too well-bred
to wear creaking shoes, light up a drawing-room.</p>

<p>She arose from the sofa, passed the man on
his return through the great room, entered the
greenhouse, proceeded along the centre walk
between rows of orange trees, and in a blaze
of light, till the white marble footway, branching
off in two directions, led round on both
sides towards a kind of arbour of sweets,
which was screened from the entrance and
principal walk by the intervention of an immense
circular stand, crowded from the marble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
floor to the glazed roof with numberless exotics.
Here she seated herself.</p>

<p>The artificial day that reigned around, the
excess of brilliancy resembling enchantment,
the very intensity of light, seemed, if not literally
shelter, at least security from sudden
intrusion, by giving proof at once that none
were near, and certainty that none could approach
unseen.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” mentally ejaculated Julia, who
by this time had renewed her meditations,
“why she did not look happy!” She paused,
and a tear or two fell. “Is it possible that he
can love a stranger better than those he has
loved all his life?” she thought, and a feeling
of something like reproach passed through her
mind. Then came a series of kindly recollections,
making it very difficult to believe that
this could be the case. Then she called to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
mind, how Edmund always used to say, he
never would marry; and how she, too, had
determined never to marry. She reflected on
this subject for some time; then asked herself
a question, but very vaguely indeed; for she
did not venture to give it the form of words,
even in thought: the purport, however, was as
follows:—if Edmund had ever said, that to be
married to her was absolutely necessary to his
happiness—what would have been her reply?
A deep blush was all the answer she gave herself.
She sat, unconscious of outward objects,
till she felt her hand softly taken. She started,
and looked up: Edmund stood before her.
“Dearest Julia!” he said, “there has so evidently
been some anxiety on your mind, some
depression on your spirits, all this day, that I
cannot resist taking, perhaps, an unwarrantable
liberty, and entreating you to tell me what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
it is that thus distresses you?” She kept her
eyes fixed on the ground, and made no reply.
“Did you not promise,” he continued, “to
permit me to call myself your friend, your
brother? and is not confidence the privilege of
friendship?” And he seated himself beside
her, still retaining the hand he had taken.</p>

<p>“I don’t wish, Edmund,” she said, her face
averted, “to hear you talk like a stranger
about taking the liberty, and all that kind of
thing: it only makes me more unhappy.”
“More unhappy!” he repeated.</p>

<p>“But, you know,” she continued, “when
you wished so very much for my friendship,
Edmund, it was when you first came home;
now—you will probably—be—everyday—making
so many new friends—that—perhaps—”
“New friends!” cried Edmund.—Then, quite
thrown off his guard, he added passionately;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
“what are all the new friends—nay, all the
friends the world contains—what the whole
world itself to me, in comparison of you, Julia!
My earliest, my kindest friend?” he added hastily,
fearful he had gone too far.</p>

<p>The assurance of a <em>friendship</em> so exclusive,
so much in unison with her own ideas on the
subject, and still more the tender and agitated
tone in which words so kind were uttered, banished
every thought of Lady Susan, and in one
moment restored Julia to perfect happiness.
For reply, she only lifted her eyes to his. Their
expression seemed to him, at the moment, to
justify him in pressing her hand to his lips,
though afterwards he thought he had done
very wrong. So much accustomed was Julia,
however, to consider the establishment of perfect
confidence between herself and Edmund,
as quite necessary and right, that in all this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
she saw but the kind reconciliation of <em>friends</em>,
and never dreamed of being surprised, as some
more experienced ladies might have been, that
no fuller or tenderer declaration followed, neither
apology, for having approached so near to
such.</p>

<p>She now felt quite certain that Edmund still
loved her better than any one else in the
world; and, therefore, she was happy. He
thought his secret still safe, because he saw he
had not given offence: indeed he saw more!
Suspicions, delightful suspicions fluttered at
his heart. He watched the brightening of her
features: yes, he could not refuse to admit the
flattering, the intoxicating conviction, that the
more his love betrayed itself, the happier Julia
evidently was! Thoughts like these ought to
have filled him with sorrow and repentance;
but they did not—they caused a joy that no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
words can paint! and this was not a moment
to resist its influence. He was gazing upon
the countenance of Julia, she had just looked
up to express kindness and confidence, tears
of pleasure had started into her eyes, and now
she was looking down again perhaps to hide
them; but they were stealing into view over
cheeks that glowed with an animating, a beautifying
confusion, which could not be termed
a mere blush, for it visibly betrayed conscious
happiness as well as bashfulness.</p>

<p>Words that, while possessed of reason, he had
determined never to utter, literally trembled
on his lips. But honour, gratitude, principle,
flew to his aid, and rescued him from the eternal
remorse, which, in a mind like his, must have
followed an avowal of sentiments, it was so
much his duty to conceal. He was enabled to
be silent—but to withdraw his eyes from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
contemplation of the lovely being before him,
to close his heart against the dangerous bliss
that contemplation afforded, was impossible!</p>

<p>Music now struck up in the great room; and
at the same instant several persons entered the
greenhouse. The next moment they were approaching
along the centre walk, and calling
Julia. Our heroine answered and made her
appearance. Edmund, still trembling from the
late agitation of his feelings, followed in silence.
But when he saw the gay group gathering round
Julia, he was struck with the sudden apprehension
of her dancing with some one of them;
and, at this time, he could not view such an
event, without a degree of horror, very disproportionate
to the importance of the subject.
He hastened therefore to her side, offered her
his arm, and whispered something, probably a
request to dance with him, as they immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
accompanied those who had come in search of
them, into the drawing-room, where quadrilles
were forming.</p>

<p>Thus was Edmund preserved from further
risk of an imprudence, which, in addition to
the endless repentance it would have cost him,
might have taught even the inexperienced
Julia the necessity of treating him with more
reserve. Hitherto, her affectionate heart, in
its enthusiasm, had ever been ready to reproach
her with estrangement and unkindness, when
she experienced but the natural timidity inseparable
from the feelings which were hourly
growing upon her; so that the very parts of
her conduct, which most strongly proved those
feelings to be more than friendship, were by
her, not unfrequently, considered as deficiencies
in the frankness and confidence due to a friend,
the companion of childhood; one, too, so delicately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
situated, who thought himself so much
obliged; who might mistake a reserve, very
proper towards strangers, (by whom Julia
meant, all the world, except her grandmamma,
Frances, Edmund, and Mr. Jackson,) for pride,
for haughtiness, for a reminding him of his
situation—No! that thought was not to be
endured! At the present moment, however,
her heart having been just lightened of an inexpressible
load of sorrow; of the first doubt
it had ever known of Edmund’s affection, she
waited not to define its movements, but joined
the dance, feeling as if she moved on air, though
in an unusual flutter of spirits. Whilst he, as
he led her to her place among those who stood
in all the pride of rank and title, birth and fortune,
felt his heart sink within him; and, as
he gazed upon her thus removed, as it were, to
an incalculable distance, from the nameless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
dependant on the bounty of her own very family,
he wondered at the mad presumption that, but
the moment before, had possessed him!</p>

<p>Yet as from time to time she smiled and
spoke to him, joy stole again into his bosom,
and he experienced an undefined species of
happiness during the remainder of the quadrille.
As soon as it was over, however, and
before Julia had taken her partner’s arm to
leave the set, Henry came up to her, and asked
her to dance the next with him. She could
not well refuse, and the moment she consented
he drew her arm over his, and led her away
to a vacant end of the room, where, as they
walked up and down, he suddenly broke silence,
saying, in a rude sort of half whisper,
“You don’t suppose, Julia, that Lord L. will
consent to your marrying this picked up fellow!
this Edmund! and I can tell you, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
manner in which you are behaving, will end
in his being forbid my aunt’s house, and indeed
the houses of all your friends and relatives.”
If ever Julia’s colour mounted, now
it flew to cheek and brow; yet, indignant as
she felt, such was her terror lest Edmund
should chance to hear one of those shocking
words, that she caught Henry’s hand, and
entreated him to lower his voice. At the same
moment she looked involuntarily towards Edmund,
and saw that he observed her; while
Henry, grasping the hand that she herself had
laid on his, carried it to his lips. She dreaded
to provoke him by withdrawing it either as
quickly or as angrily as she felt inclined to do;
and he held it fast, with the most malicious
satisfaction in her dilemma, which he perfectly
understood; while, as if to mortify her the
more, he kept up, by countenance and manner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
a sort of dumb show of tender solicitude. She,
however, forced back her presence of mind,
and, in an under tone of suppressed vexation,
trying at the same time to look dignified and
as angry as her youth and natural gentleness
would permit, said, “do not for a moment
imagine, Henry, that I dread your rude,
impertinent remarks on my own account,
but take care you do not let one word be
heard, which can wound the feelings of Edmund.
As for the motive of my anxiety on
this point, if you are not capable of understanding
it, remain in ignorance of it, or judge
it what you please! It is to my father, not
to you, sir, that I shall give an account of
my actions.”</p>

<p>“Mighty fine!” he replied; “but, Julia, if
my anxiety for you proceeds from my own
attachment, and, I suppose I may presume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
where Edmund does, you cannot be surprised
that I should not wish to see you throw yourself
away; but I believe,” he added, with a
sneer, provoked at the evident scorn depicted
on Julia’s countenance at the mention of his
own attachment, “you are tolerably safe, as
the gallant Captain Montgomery happens not
to be at leisure to accept your ladyship’s proffered
affections, being otherwise engaged.”</p>

<p>It is wonderful how many times in the course
of the evening Julia repeated over to herself
the two words, “otherwise engaged.”</p>

<p>“The world is come to a pretty pass,” continued
Henry, “when two titled ladies are pulling
caps for a fellow without a name!” Julia’s
bosom was swelling with indignation, pride,
and anger; she was dying to give them utterance,
but she felt that, now, she dare not
trust herself to speak, while her fingers, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
despite of her utmost efforts, being still held,
as in a vice, she could not disengage herself
without a publicity she wished to avoid. Indeed,
Henry seemed careless how roughly he
treated the delicate little hand thus imprisoned
in his; for now, as at all times, for reasons
best known to himself, he was more intent on
persuading others that he was well with his
cousin, than on really making her believe that
he loved her.</p>

<p>At this moment Sir Archibald, who had been
standing with his arms folded at a little distance,
came hastily forward, and seized Henry
by the collar, crying out—“Villain! villain!
villain! have I found you at last?” Henry
disengaged himself, and turned on his assailant,
with a look of pale rage so horrible that,
had time and place agreed, no less than a mortal
struggle seemed likely to ensue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Julia uttered a scream of terror: all was in a
moment confusion and consternation. Lord
Arandale, however, interfered, and finally prevailed
on his nephew to leave the room for the
evening; explaining to him in hasty whispers,
as he almost forcibly led him aside, that
Sir Archibald, from the bewildered state of his
mind, was evidently unconscious of the lapse
of time, and must in consequence have mistaken
him for his unfortunate father, against
whom he had but too just cause of complaint,
and to whose memory a discussion of the subject
would be by no means creditable.</p>

<p>Julia stood trembling, and, for a moment,
alone; the next, Edmund was at her side. He
saw that there were tears in her eyes. He
offered his arm to lead her to a seat. She took
it with a heavy sigh, but avoided his look of
enquiry. He felt much less happy than he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
been. Why had she caught Henry’s hand? Why
had she suffered him to press hers to his lips—and
retain it, too, so long? Why had she
looked so deeply interested in what he said?
And what was the cause of her present emotion?</p>

<p>Every one had of course been much alarmed;
several of the young ladies had fled into the
greenhouse, whence they now peeped through
the glass door. Lady Morven was near fainting,
and Mr. Graham was unable to assist her.</p>

<p>Some one proposed music as the most likely
thing to calm Sir Archibald’s excited nerves,
he was so fond of it. One of the Miss Morvens
was prevailed upon to return to the
drawing-room and play an air on the pianoforte—it
had no effect. Lady Arandale requested
Julia to sing; she at first wished much
to decline, but Lady Arandale pressed her request,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and Julia felt that it was necessary to
consent. Sir Archibald was still walking up
and down with hasty and uneven strides,
leaning on the arm of Lord Arandale; Julia’s
song commenced. Sir Archibald’s violent gesticulations
gradually became less frequent; his
step, as she proceeded, became slower, his
countenance less furiously agitated. By insensible
degrees he approached, and, at length
stood with folded arms, immediately before
our heroine.</p>

<p>Julia exerted, on this occasion, but a small
share of the power of voice which she possessed;
yet, every one was delighted with the
magical effect the then state of her own feelings
gave to a pathetic air. By the time the song
came to its conclusion, Sir Archibald was
standing almost directly beneath the great
centre lustre, just so far removed from its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
immediate perpendicular, as to admit of its
strong flood of light streaming full on his face
and figure. His attitude was still the fixed
one in which he had hitherto listened, but
now he seemed unconscious of the presence
of any one. His perfectly white hair was
made more remarkable by the brightness that
shone upon it; his countenance was calm,
every passion being stilled, every effort laid
aside, while an expression of woe, of hopelessness,
such as can proceed only from the
utterly broken heart, had settled on every thus
relaxed feature, and large tears, which glittered
in the strong light, were silently rolling
over his cheeks.</p>

<p>An absolute stillness reigned throughout the
apartment for some moments, when, supper
being announced, it was agreed, almost in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
whispers, that they should retire quietly to
the eating room without disturbing Sir Archibald;
leaving a servant at the drawing-room
door to observe his movements.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">“Really,”</span> said Lady Morven, as she
lolled back in her seat at the supper table,
after asking Mr. Graham to help her to some
wine and water, “my nerves can’t stand such
alarms! and I dare say you are quite ill too,
Mr. Graham.”</p>

<p>“This is the first time Sir Archy has shewn
symptoms of violence,” observed Lady Arandale,
“hitherto he has been quite harmless,
an object more of commiseration than of
fear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>“I must, I believe,” said Lord Arandale,
“be under the necessity of requesting my
nephew, Mr. St. Aubin, to take a few days
sport with some of the neighbouring gentlemen,
while Sir Archibald remains here; for
never shall my door,” and he spoke with the
honest energy of good feeling, “be closed
against the shattered remnant, in mind and in
body, which still exists of poor Oswald—the
once gay companion of many a merry, many
a thoughtless hour, spent, some of them beneath
his own hospitable roof, where, even I,
may have possibly, though innocently, contributed
my share to his ultimate ruin!” Then,
addressing our hero in particular, he continued,
“At the age of fifteen he was his own master,
and at that early period commenced the career
of folly, dissipation, and gaming which led,
finally, to his destruction. St. Aubin was one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
of the set,” he proceeded, lowering his tone;
“it was he who drew him into high play, and
who won from him the principal part of his
estates, unfairly too it is generally believed.
There was some agreement also, about the
winner paying the loser’s then existing debts;
but when St. Aubin got possession he sold
the estates, or his interest in them, to Jews,
and disappeared, leaving Oswald to answer
his creditors as he might. There were informalities
in the sale, it is thought; but however
that is, or was, the Jews keep possession,
and Oswald has not a title or paper of any
kind to shew: St. Aubin, on various pretexts,
had got all into his own hands. Poor Oswald’s
state of mind, too, adds greatly to the difficulty
of clearing up any part of the unfortunate
business. In some of his ravings he
declares vehemently that he staked but his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
life use, and that, could he find the villain St.
Aubin, and make him produce certain papers,
his boy, (Oswald’s boy I mean,) would enjoy
the whole property at his father’s death.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span> entered her room, arm and arm with
Frances, pondering in what words she should
ask a certain question, which she meant to put
to her sister, as soon as Alice should retire;
for Henry’s remarks had aroused again some
of the painful suspicions, which Edmund’s
soothing attentions had so lately laid asleep.</p>

<p>Frances made many droll critiques in French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
on Lady Morven, Mr. Graham, &amp;c. &amp;c.
Forced, unmeaning smiles were Julia’s only
replies.</p>

<p>At length, both the sisters’ heads were laid
on their downy pillows, and Alice had left the
room. Still Julia had not determined in what
precise words to put her important question;
besides, though the candles had been extinguished,
there happened to be an impertinent
bit of trundling coal among the embers of the
fire, which sent from its side a bright flickering
blaze, and caused a most obtrusive light to
enter the bed, by means of a small, neglected
opening between the foot curtains; and, until
it should be quite dark, Julia did not wish to
speak.</p>

<p>Frances put her arms about her sister’s neck,
kissed her, and bade her good night. Julia
returned the good night with equal kindness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
as was their custom. She was again silent.
At last the blaze went out, and the room became
nearly dark.</p>

<p>“What—was that—you were saying—to
me—when we were dressing for dinner, Frances—about—about
Edmund, you know?”</p>

<p>“What!—What?”—said Frances, with a
start, for she had just dropped asleep.</p>

<p>“What—was it you were saying—I say—before
dinner, you know?”</p>

<p>“Saying! About what?”</p>

<p>“About—about Edmund, you know.”</p>

<p>“What about Edmund?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you know, about him and Lady Susan,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, about their going to be married!” said
Frances, rousing herself to enter fully, as it
were, into the amusing subject; then, with
animation, and a voice of confidence, she continued,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
“I really think it will take place; and
he is certainly very fortunate; for she has a
cheerful, happy temper, and her affection for
him is truly generous and disinterested!” The
darkness covered Julia’s changing colour, and
her starting tears, also, which she now gulped
down, as she replied, “Her affection indeed!
What can her affection be, in comparison of
those who have loved him always!”</p>

<p>“Do you mean any one in particular?” asked
Frances.</p>

<p>“No—” replied Julia, “that is—yes. I
mean, you and I, you know.” “Certainly,”
said Frances, “we have loved him always; but
then, you know, we are not going to marry
him.”</p>

<p>“No, I suppose papa would not think it
right, if we were,” said Julia.</p>

<p>“You may be sure of that!” replied Frances.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
“It is very plain, from his letters, and from
what grandmamma and Mr. Jackson said the
other day, about Henry’s nonsense, what sort
of people papa intends us to marry.”</p>

<p>“I shall never marry any one while I live!”
said Julia, with great earnestness.</p>

<p>“You can’t tell, you know, Julia,” replied
Frances; “you may happen to fall in love;
and if you do, it will be desperately! for you
know how enthusiastic you always are, about
any one you care for!”</p>

<p>“Fall in love with a stranger, indeed!” exclaimed
Julia. Then, after a momentary pause,
she added, “do you think yourself, Frances,
that Lady Susan can possibly love him as well
as—as we do?”</p>

<p>“Why, I dare say,” replied Frances, “if
any thing should prevent their being married,
that Lady Susan would forget him by and bye,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
whereas you and I shall always have the same
regard for Edmund, that we have had for him
all our lives. But, on the other hand, there is
Lady Susan going to waive all about his unknown
birth, that some people, you know, are
so ill natured about. She says, his own nobility
is more to her, than any he could derive
from all the ancestors that ever were in the
world.”</p>

<p>“Did she say so to you, Frances?” asked
Julia.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied her sister, “and she is going,
she says, to give him, most cheerfully, her
hand, her heart, and her fifty thousand pounds,
in preference to many of the first young noblemen
in the kingdom, among whom she
might choose; and you and I are not going to
do all that for him, you know!”</p>

<p>Julia sighed heavily, and made no immediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
reply.—In a little time she said, “Do you think,
Frances, you could do so much for Edmund?”</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t know,” replied Frances;
“though I certainly love Edmund next to you
and grandmamma, yet I have no particular wish
to be married to him; for I can love him just
as well, you know, when he is married to Lady
Susan. But you, Julia, who were always so
enthusiastic, would you like now to sacrifice so
much for him?”</p>

<p>“I could do any thing for those I love!”
said Julia, in a scarcely audible whisper, and
blushing, though none could see her.</p>

<p>“Oh, that is, you mean, if it were absolutely
necessary to their happiness!” rejoined her sister.
“I should not like, either, to make poor
Edmund unhappy! But then, you know, it is
not necessary to his happiness; for he wishes
himself to be married to Lady Susan.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“But are you sure of that, Frances?” asked
Julia, as recollections crowded in upon her
mind, “are you sure of that? for I am certain
it is impossible for him to love Lady Susan,
or any one, as much as—as he loves—that
is, seems to love—those he has always
loved.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Frances, “that there cannot
be a more amiable or affectionate disposition
in the world than Edmund’s; yet, still he
never showed me any such excessive sort of
love, that he could not love another person as
well, or better, I suppose, if he were going to
be married to them! But, to be sure, you were
always his favourite. I remember when we
were children I used to be vexed at it sometimes,
but since we have been grown up, I
don’t mind people loving you best, because I
know you deserve it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Julia wept on her sister’s breast, and persuaded
herself that her tears were those of gratitude
and tenderness, caused by Frances’ kind
expressions. In a little time she said, “But
how are you sure, Frances, that Edmund wishes
to be married to Lady Susan?”</p>

<p>“Because he asked her to marry him, when
they were in the cottage this morning! She
told me so herself, just before I came up to
dress for dinner, you know.” Julia asked no
more questions; nor did she utter another
word that night. Frances went on explaining
about Lord and Lady Arandale knowing nothing
of the matter, as yet, and what Lady Susan
meant to do to obtain their consent, &amp;c.; but
having the conversation all to herself, she soon
began to articulate slowly and with frequent
unnecessary pauses, and, finally, fell asleep:
upon which, Julia began to draw her hitherto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
suppressed sighs audibly. She wept for a time
with bitterness. She thought for hours. When
she recollected looks or words of tenderness
she wept afresh; but, when she called to mind
such circumstances as Edmund’s having, at
any time, taken her hand in his, or pressed it
to his lips, she blushed till her cheeks seemed
to burn, and wondered how she could ever have
permitted any thing so very wrong: she had
always called him brother Edmund, certainly;
but she ought to have remembered that he was
not really her brother. She then asked herself
the following startling questions:—If her feelings
for Edmund and her conduct towards him
had hitherto been guided by the friendship of a
sister, why should they not be still the same?
what change had taken place in their relative
situations? This candid mode of treating the
subject puzzled her not a little. At length she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
tried to persuade herself that friendship, or even
sisterly regard for one who loved their friend
or sister better than any one else in the world,
was a very different thing from friendship for
one who felt a stronger affection for some other
object. “And does Edmund, then, really
love Lady Susan better than he loves me?” Her
tears now flowed again, and, wearied out, she
fell asleep, without having come to any conclusion
but that she was wretched, and that
all the recollections which, hitherto, had given
her pleasure, now gave her pain.</p>

<p>As soon as reason had abdicated her seat,
fancy ascended the throne. Confusion succeeded,
and the busy turmoil of weary imaginings,
and painful contrarieties, robbed sleep of
her healing balm. Wanderings alone on starless
nights—Dreary wildernesses in the blaze
of noon, without one living object to be seen—Crowded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
ball-rooms—Edmund leading Lady
Susan past to join the dance, with a countenance
so changed, so cold; and all interspersed
with short glimpses of Lodore and happy childhood:
till, at length, by the time she ought to
have been awaking in the morning, her dream
(<em>not</em> from “foregone conclusions,” but from outward
causes,) took the following form. She
thought she saw Edmund and Lady Susan coming
towards her in one of the shrubbery walks
at Arandale. She tried to avoid them, but could
scarcely move an inch at a time. They overtook
her. Edmund, she thought, to her utter
astonishment, put one arm round her, and drew
her towards him; while the other, she now
perceived, was around Lady Susan. Amazed
at this audacious freedom, and especially indignant
at such partnership in love, she struggled
to free herself, and, with almost a bound,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
awoke. Arms really were around her, laughing
eyes were close to her’s, and a soft voice named
her. But it was that of Frances, who had, all
this time, been trying every means, but hitherto
in vain, to awake her sister; so heavy was the
late sleep induced by the anxious thoughts of
the night, and the busy dreams of the morning.
Indeed it was not quite two hours since Julia
had first closed her eyes.</p>

<p>“Bless me,” cried Alice, as she entered the
room, “can that be the bagpipes for breakfast,
and it has only just gone ten! Well, I thought
my Lady Arandale would have taken a sleep
this morning, after being up a matter of half
the night.”</p>

<p>“Were we so much later than usual then?”
asked Frances.</p>

<p>“Much as common, my Lady,” replied Alice;
“but when the men went in to take the supper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
things away, my Lady and my Lord, both, were
so busy with Mr. Edmund, Captain Montgomery,
I should say, that they were sent away
again, and not rung for, for two hours. I wish
all may be true that was said in the hall,” she
recommenced, after having assisted her young
ladies to dress for some time in silence; “for
Mr. Edmund is one that every body loves; and
I, for one, should rejoice in his good luck—and
think it nothing so strange, neither; though
the old butler put himself in such a passion,
and said that Lady Susan was a wife for the
first duke in the land—and—”</p>

<p>“I have told you before, Alice,” said Julia,
making an effort to conceal her real feelings
under the mask of pettishness, “that you are
not to repeat the conversations of the hall-table
in our room.”</p>

<p>“I beg pardon, my Lady, but I only meant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
to say as how my Lady Arandale came to be
late. But I am sure I repeated nothing: neither
what my Lady Susan’s maid said, nor
what my Lady Arandale’s maid said, nor
what my Lord’s man said, about the time
they were at Lodore, nor all I said myself
about the power of money that Mr. Edmund
had won from the French, and about what
a nice, handsome young gentleman he was;—but
for just a kind wish for one that every
one loves, I didn’t think it would have given
offence.”</p>

<p>“You can never give offence by wishing
well to any one, Alice,” said Frances, “but it
was not necessary to repeat what other servants
said: that was all. I suppose,” she added, in
an under tone to her sister, as they went down
stairs together, “he was asking papa and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
mamma’s consent, last night. And after his fine
resolutions, too!” she added, laughing, “never
to think of marriage till he had discovered all
about his birth, name, and so forth.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> breakfast, Sir Archibald was again the
subject of conversation. “He is still late to
his breakfast,” said Lady Arandale, “and
when he does come he will tack but one cup
o’ coffee, without sugar, cream, or bread; so
totally have his excesses destroyed his stomach!”</p>

<p>“How dreadfully broken down he is in appearance,
since I last saw him!” observed the
General.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Lord Arandale, “poor Oswald<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
was once, I think, the handsomest fellow
in Scotland! Do you remember how well he
used to sing, General?”</p>

<p>“His voice is still peculiarly melodious,”
said Lady Susan, who was looking as grave
as she had done at dinner the day before;
though Edmund was seated next to her,
and, seemingly, paying her very solicitous attention.</p>

<p>“How poor Maria could have given St. Aubin
the preference,” continued his lordship,
“I cannot imagine; Oswald, however, married
a very elegant woman—one of the Ladies Allan.
Your friend, Lord Fitz-Ullin’s first wife,”
he added, turning to Edmund, “was one of
the sisters. The Fitz-Ullin family seem to have
modelled their conduct towards poor Lady Oswald,
by that of her own more immediate relatives:
indeed it is not improbable that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
may have by this time forgotten her very existence;
for the death of her sister, and Lord
Fitz-Ullin’s second marriage, have, for many
years, sundered the connecting link: while a
feeling of pride, very natural, I allow, but which
Lady Oswald certainly ought to have sacrificed
to the good of her child, has hitherto, I apprehend,
prevented her making any direct claim
on their notice.”</p>

<p>The mention of Lord Fitz-Ullin’s family as
connected with the Oswalds, made a lively
impression on Edmund’s mind. That the
friendless, destitute boy, whom he had been
planning to protect and assist with all the
limited means he could command, should possess
legitimate claims on his powerful and
kind patron, and on his young friend, Oscar
Ormond, opened new and flattering prospects
for the son of poor Sir Archibald, of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Edmund was determined not to lose sight.
The friendless, the destitute seemed to him as
more peculiarly his brethren than the rest of
mankind. Nor was this a parade of sentiment
with Edmund, even to his own heart; it
was rather an involuntary emotion, upon the
impulse of which he frequently acted before
he had considered what were his motives.
His affectionate and gentle nature yearned for
the tender family sympathies of which his
peculiar circumstances deprived him; and he
sometimes took a melancholy pleasure in thinking
that he thus belonged to a large family,
namely, the unfortunates. Henry entered the
breakfast-room looking very pale.</p>

<p>“There is no one missing now but poor
Sir Archibald,” observed Lady Arandale. The
butler came in with a supply of hot rolls.
Her ladyship enquired if any one had been in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Sir Archibald’s room this morning. The man
answered that he believed Sir Archibald had
left the castle, as he had gone out very early.
“If he has gone off in this sudden manner,”
observed Lord Arandale, “it is probable that
a lucid interval has arrived; for at such times
he always hastens to his miserable retreat in
the island; avoiding most especially those
old friends and associates whose society he
seeks when his mind is in an unsettled state.
I do not know that I have ever seen on his
countenance that expression of utter woe, unmingled
with cheating phantasies, which it
wore last night, except on the approach of
reason; before which it is feasible to suppose
that all the airy visions of the madman flee
away, reducing our poor friend to the unalleviated
consciousness of his actual situation.
Young men!” continued the Earl, looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
round at his nephews, who were busily engaged
in eating cold pie, “surely I need not, no one
need preach against gambling in this neighbourhood
while such a beacon light is placed
on high to warn all off the rock on which poor
Oswald became a wreck! Aye, a piteous
wreck indeed!” he added, murmuring to himself,
and moving his head slowly from side to
side, as Mrs. Montgomery sometimes did, for
it was a family symptom. Then, after a moment’s
pause, addressing Edmund in particular,
he said: “This will make some little alteration
necessary in the arrangements we concerted
last night. You have breakfasted, I
believe, Captain Montgomery?” Edmund assented.
“Will you come with me, then, to
my study?” Edmund arose and accompanied
his lordship. Most of the party quitted their
seats about the same time; and Frances said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
to Julia, as they walked together towards a
window: “It seems Edmund has got over all
his mighty objections to matrimony!”</p>

<p>“Yes—they are in a wonderful hurry, it
would appear,” said Julia. “But what can
Sir Archibald’s going away have to do with
their arrangements?”</p>

<p>“I cannot imagine,” replied Frances. “Perhaps
Edmund is about to turn out to be Sir
Archibald’s son.”</p>

<p>“Sir Archibald’s son, you know,” returned
Julia, who had inwardly studied the subject in
all its bearings, “is mentioned as a boy; besides,
he is living with Lady Oswald in the
Isle of Man; and never was lost or found in
infancy, as Edmund was.”</p>

<p>“That is true!” answered Frances, “that
won’t do—but he must be some way related to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Sir Archibald, (for what my uncle said, must
mean something,) and in that case, I dare say,
they will consent to the marriage.”</p>

<p>Julia looked at Lady Susan, and again wondered
why she did not look happy.</p>

<p>“That is a good lad, that Captain Montgomery,”
observed Lady Arandale. (Lad is a
term applied by elderly Scotch ladies to all
men of all sizes and ages, not quite as old as
themselves.) “He has made a good sum of
money, it seems,” continued her ladyship,
“and will make a very good use of it, I dare
say.” Lady Susan coloured slightly, and told
Henry he had eaten no breakfast. “Are you
all prepared for the race-course, young ladies?”
inquired Lady Arandale. “We had
better arrange how the carriages shall be
filled.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“There is my barouche for any one that
likes,” said Lady Morven, “for I shall positively
go in the curricle with Graham.”</p>

<p>“We can accommodate two ladies,” said
Julia, “if Henry and Captain Montgomery
ride.” It was the first time she had named
Edmund, Captain Montgomery, and the sound
of her own voice pronouncing the words,
startled her.</p>

<p>“There is no scarcity of carriages, my
dear,” replied Lady Arandale; “there is my
barouche, and my lord’s chariot, and the family
coach, and the General’s barouche, and all
the young men’s curricles and nondescripts; I
only mean to plan how the several parties may
like best to be disposed of. As for my Lady
Morven’s barouche, I advise that none who
regard their necks may trust themselves with
her horses.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>“La! ma’am,” interrupted Lady Morven,
“who would drive any thing but blood-horses!”</p>

<p>“I fancy, my dear,” returned Lady Arandale,
“my Lord drives as good horses as your
ladyship; though they are not mad ones! It
was but the last races, you know, that one of
your ladyship’s leaders killed an unfortunate
boy.”</p>

<p>“I beg your la’—ship’s pardon a thousand
times,” observed Mr. Graham, “but that certainly
was the boy’s own fault.”</p>

<p>“How so, pray?”</p>

<p>“Why, the boy should have staid at home,
and, I will venture to affirm, that Lady Morven’s
leader would never have hurt him!
Really such creatures should keep themselves
from under the feet of people of fashion.”</p>

<p>“It happened on the king’s highway,” retorted
Lady Arandale, “and people of fashion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
have no right to infest that with animals dangerous,
or even inconvenient, to the poorest of
his Majesty’s subjects. And as for my Lady
Morven, if she takes my advice, she will appear
on the ground in my barouche, rather than in
an open carriage with any gentleman.”</p>

<p>“La! ma’am,” cried Lady Morven, “if I
had used my own barouche, I should have sat
in the dicky seat with Graham, and made him
drive!”</p>

<p>“Well, my dear, if your husband chooses to
give you your own way,” said the old lady, “I
shall not interfere.”</p>

<p>“I give Morven his own way, and he gives
me mine. That’s all fair, you know.”</p>

<p>Lady Arandale, without vouchsafing further
reply, desired her daughter and nieces to
get ready, as the carriages would all come
round in half an hour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span> we shall just step into the library,
and see what Lord Arandale and Edmund have
been about.</p>

<p>“We may now, I believe, consider matters
settled,” remarked his lordship, as he folded
a letter, which Edmund having perused, had
just returned to him. “I know what are her
ladyship’s wishes, and I can, I think, answer
for her cheerful consent. Indeed, she will, I
make no doubt, rejoice in having found such a
friend and protector for her child.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>“Your lordship’s good opinion is truly
flattering!” replied Edmund, “and I hope,
when the well being, and I may, perhaps,
say happiness through life, of a young and innocent
being, are committed to my keeping,
I may not undertake the charge, with light or
careless ideas of its responsibility.”</p>

<p>So, as Frances would say, they really are
going to be married!</p>

<p>“With your principles, Captain Montgomery,
there can be little doubt of your fulfilling
well any duties you take upon yourself.
If the boy is tolerably well disposed, he has
every chance, in such hands, of turning out an
honour to his profession: though it can fall to
the lot of but few to adorn it quite as brilliantly
as Captain Montgomery has done!”</p>

<p>Lord Arandale is speaking of young Oswald,
Sir Archibald’s boy; and the letter which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
has just finished folding, he is, we perceive,
now directing to Lady Oswald, the boy’s
mother. In fact, Edmund had applied to his
lordship the night before, for the purpose of
having it thus arranged. He felt a delicacy,
as a total stranger, in obtruding his offers of
service on Lady Oswald, and had requested
Lord Arandale to take, (on the plea of his long
friendship for Sir Archibald,) nominally, the
lead in the business, by addressing a letter to
her ladyship, saying, that he had now an
opportunity of placing her son in the Euphrasia
frigate, commanded by Captain Montgomery;
and stating that the attending circumstances
were particularly favourable, as young
Oswald would thus have an opportunity of
forming a desirable intimacy with his cousin,
Lord Ormond, who was the particular friend
of Captain Montgomery; and of becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
personally known to Lord Fitz-Ullin, who, it
could not be doubted, would take an interest
in the advancement of so near a connexion,
when thus placed within the sphere of his
observation. On the strength of a lady not
understanding those matters, the gentlemen
ventured to enclose a bank bill for a moderate
sum, as advance of pay to Mr. Oswald for his
fitting out.</p>

into every recess of every window, and cast a
glance over every group, but evidently saw not

the greenhouse, and at length discovered Julia

towards them, offering to assist them; for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
had been so much engaged with Lady Susan

colouring at the idea that his benevolent purpose
should be thus made public.</p>

<p>“Oh, we know quite well, I assure you,”
she replied playfully.</p>

<p>“Let me do that for you, Julia!” said Edmund,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
starting forward to assist her he named,
in plucking a branch of geranium, which she
was very awkwardly attempting to reach.</p>

<p>“Good Heavens, Julia! what is the matter?”
he exclaimed, catching up her hand;
for in presenting the flower he had just pulled,
he perceived that her countenance expressed
the utmost wretchedness; and that her tears,
in despite of an evident struggle to suppress
them, were falling fast. She turned away,
drew her hand forcibly out of his, and hurried
to a further part of the greenhouse. He
thought of the hand he had seen her give to
Henry; permit him to retain so long, and even
raise to his lips; and a vague sensation of pain
and dread came over him. He followed her,
however; he found her hastily drying her eyes.
Again she endeavoured to avoid him.</p>

<p>“I have no right,” he said, detaining her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
“to demand your confidence, Julia; perhaps,
I am guilty of impertinence in thus seeking it—withhold
it, if it must be so; but do not
make me miserable, by seeming not only unhappy,
but seriously offended with me!” His
voice and manner renewed Julia’s habitual
feelings of tenderness.</p>

<p>“I have no desire to make you miserable, Edmund!
I wish you, sincerely wish you all happiness,”
she replied, in a scarcely audible voice,
“but do not speak to me now; do not speak to
me, just now!”</p>

<p>He endeavoured to take her hand, and was
about to reply; but she shrunk from his touch,
and hastened, as for refuge, into the midst of the
company in the drawing-room. He followed,
and stood near her in silence. Frances had
quitted the greenhouse, as soon as she made
her laughing speech to Edmund, and, consequently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
without perceiving her sister’s emotion.</p>

<p>At this moment Colonel Murray, of the
Moorlands, was announced. He led by the
hand a fine boy of about twelve or thirteen;
with fair, curly, glossy hair; fair skin, glowing
cheeks, soft hazel eyes, and a sweet open expression
of countenance; the mouth and smile,
as was afterwards universally observed, very
like Edmund’s. He was dressed in the uniform
of one of the Highland hunts, and carried in
his hand a cap and plume, like young Norval’s.</p>

<p>“This is Arthur Oswald, the son of our
friend Sir Archibald,” said the Laird, presenting
him to Lord Arandale.</p>

<p>“Indeed!” cried his lordship, taking the
boy’s hand, and glancing a look towards Edmund,
which was answered by one of intelligence
on his part. “I am truly happy to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
him—fine little fellow! How did you leave your
mamma, my dear? Well, I hope?”</p>

<p>“She was quite well when we came away,”
he answered, “but that’s a good while now.”</p>

<p>The Laird explained, that Arthur had been
brought over to the mainland by his father,
who had left him at his, the Laird’s house, since
his first arrival. The Laird added, that he
was taking Arthur with him to the races, and
had called at Arandale, for the purpose of joining
himself, if permitted, to their agreeable
party. He might have said, further, but of
course he did not, that he had furnished Arthur
with the becoming dress he wore on the
occasion. Every one noticed the young stranger
in some kind or complimentary manner; and
Lord Arandale, presenting him particularly to
Edmund, asked him if he should like to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
sailor. The boy answered, with quickness and
energy, that he should indeed.</p>

<p>“Then, this gentleman,” said the Earl, “will
take you with him, and teach you to be a sailor;
and a good and a great one, if you follow his
example.”</p>

<p>Edmund had already taken Arthur’s hand,
drawn him towards him, and seemed as it were,
to appropriate him. The boy now looked up
in his face, as if for a confirmation of what
Lord Arandale had said. Edmund smiled
kindly; and Arthur answered the smile by that
genuine mark of a child’s confidence, a soft
pressure of the hand that held his. Edmund
felt at the moment, notwithstanding the strangeness
of Julia’s manner, that it was impossible
to be quite miserable, while one has the power
of doing any good. This pleasurable impulse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
called up the natural ambition of the heart to
be happy; and, scarcely conscious why, he
turned to Julia, but found, what he had never
found before this morning, that he could not
meet her eye. He moved a step or two, which
brought him near her. He addressed some
remark to her; she answered without looking
up, affecting to be very busy searching for
something in her reticule.</p>

<p>It must have been, thought Edmund, the
imprudence with which I last night betrayed
my feelings, which has thus, upon serious consideration,
offended her; though, at the time,
she did not, certainly, show displeasure. And
he sighed heavily. She now raised her eyes,
with involuntary quickness, to his face. She
had never seen so much unhappiness there.
She looked at him, for the space of a second,
with a mingled expression of surprise and tenderness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
which he could in no way comprehend.
Edmund stooped, and, on pretence of looking
over her shoulder out of a window facing which
she stood, he whispered softly:—“I see, Julia,
that the presumption of my manner, last night,
has offended you; justly, I allow; but have
some compassion for an involuntary error!
Some pity for—for——” The low and hurried
accents of Edmund; the confused state of
Julia’s own feelings; the busy voices of the
rest of the party; all prevented her hearing
more than a few occasional words, from which
she collected, only, that Edmund saw her
change of manner, and sought to know the
cause. This, of course, she could not explain.
“Soon, I must return to sea,” he continued,
finding he could obtain neither look nor word;
“for what foreign station, or for how many
years, I know not! Possibly, I may never see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
you again, Julia. Do not, then, by a resentment
so determined, so unforgiving, embitter
the few short moments to which I would fondly
cling, as the only solace of my solitary, and
hopeless existence!” This last sentence, which,
from the growing warmth of his manner, was
uttered in a somewhat more audible tone than
the rest, was all that Julia had distinctly heard.</p>

<p>“Your solitary and hopeless existence, Edmund!”
she exclaimed, with a look and voice
of astonishment.</p>

<p>“Yes, Julia; such feelings as mine must
be hopeless! it is the only apology that can be
made for their presumption.”</p>

<p>“Lord Arandale has refused his consent,”
thought Julia, “and shall I add to his evident
affliction? I imagined him perfectly happy!
and that he had found means to be so, independent
of all his first friends; or I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
never have been so unkind to him.” At the
conclusion of this reflection, she looked up
with an expression that, for a moment, almost
restored him to happiness.</p>

<p>The company were now filing off, on their
way down to the carriages. Edmund and Julia
were the last in the room. She paused, gave
him her hand, and said:—“I once promised
you to be always your friend! I renew that
promise now; and I know I can also answer
for the unshaken continuance of Frances’s kind
regard. Will this, in any degree, console you,
Edmund, under those mortified and disappointed
feelings, of which you speak so bitterly?”
And she spoke a little bitterly herself.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! It will—it must—it does!” he
exclaimed, pressing the offered hand to his
lips. She drew it gently away; but took his
arm as they followed the rest of the party. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
he considered it so very wrong even to hope,
she thought, why did he ask her to marry
him? and Lady Susan, herself, had told
Frances that he had done so.</p>

<p>Edmund was, or at least believed that he
ought to have been, cheered in one point of
view; for Julia appeared to be reconciled to
him, appeared to have pardoned his rashness:
but, he was saddened too: indeed, there was a
peculiar dreariness about his present feelings;
for it now seemed to him, that they fully understood
each other, and that Julia had forbid
him to hope. Yet, he thought, he had never
hoped. What was it, then, of which he now
deplored the loss? Some undefined, unacknowledged
expectations, must have been
founded on the pleasure he had so often, with
intoxicating delight, marked in Julia, when he
had, by look or word, betrayed some part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
that love, he thought it his duty not to declare;
till his birth should be distinctly ascertained;
a contingency which, when put in high
spirits by a smile, he had, sometimes, thought
by no means improbable! Now, Julia knew,
(he believed,) the full extent of his love; and
she had showed any thing but gratification.
She had, it is true, mingled with her displeasure
at his presumption, a generous compassion
for his sufferings; and she had offered
him, mournfully, but kindly, friendship as a
consolation for the hopelessness of the passion
she had yet decidedly checked. And was not
Julia’s friendship an inestimable treasure?
Was he not an object of regard, of affection to
her?—Oh, how delightful that idea; were it
not blasted by the thought, that he must, one
day, see her bestow warmer, dearer, fonder
feelings on another! on some one, who having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
all else that this world can give, must have
their abundance crowned by the bliss of possessing
Julia’s love! Or should she ever be
Henry’s? He looked on her as he asked himself
this question; but he thought of the mountainous
waves of the sea in a storm, and, for a
moment, felt the sinful wish that he might be
overwhelmed by them, ere so terrible an apprehension
should be realized!</p>

<p>Julia, as she descended the stairs, and stepped
into the carriage, wondered how Edmund could
love a comparative stranger, as Lady Susan certainly
was, so much as to be rendered thus unhappy
on her account: but he was unhappy,
and therefore she would never be unkind to him
again! She could not, it was true, have the
same pleasure in feeling that excessive friendship
for him now, as when she thought her
friendship was all the happiness he desired:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
yet, if it was all the happiness he possessed,
it should never be taken from him.</p>

<p>Before the company quitted the drawing-room
for the carriages, a trifling circumstance
occurred, which we omitted mentioning in its
place. We shall, however, relate it now, as it
may hereafter be remembered with interest.
At the time that Edmund, as we have already
described, moved towards Julia, Henry happened
to take up nearly the same relative position
with respect to Arthur, which our hero
had filled the moment before. The boy, who
had not noticed the change, laid hold of the
side of Henry’s coat, very gently; and having
long had the habit of thinking and speaking of
his father with a degree both of seriousness
and of mystery, on account of his unhappy
state of mind, he said in a whisper: “But
where is poor papa?”</p>

<div class="verse">The arching neck to page’s soft caress.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> carriages, as is the custom at the Ayr
races, drove to a stand-house, the upper story
of which consists of one large room three sides
glass. Here all the female part of the best
company collect, while the gentlemen, in general,
at least the younger ones, ride about the
course, and, from time to time, join their parties
in the stand-house, fraught with intelligence
respecting the horses, &amp;c. All was new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
to the sisters. Every equipage that drove up,
produced enquiries as to who those were descending
from it, &amp;c.</p>

<p>“Blair is riding this way, I see,” said Colonel
Morven to Frances, “he is going to behave
prettily, and hand Mrs. Blair and his daughter
out of the carriage. Mrs. Blair is a very
charming woman!”</p>

<p>“Which did you say was Mr. Blair?” asked
Frances.</p>

<p>“Mr.!” repeated the Colonel, “pray do not
insult my friend Blair, by calling him Mr.!
we have no such appellation among our Scotchmen
of any consequence.” “What, then, is
his title?” demanded Frances. “No actual
title.—He is Blair of Blair—the head of an
ancient family, and must not be mister’d like
a nobody!” Another barouche drove up.
“Here comes Auchencru’s carriage,” said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Colonel. “Is that Mrs. Auchencru stepping
out now?” asked Frances. “Mrs. Oswald,”
said the Colonel. “Why, did you not say
the name was Auchen——something?” “The
name of Oswald’s place is Auchencru, and,
in Scotland, you must always call men by
the names of their places;—not so their ladies.”
“I see I must never speak to or of any one
while I am in Scotland!” cried Frances.</p>

<p>“Oh! who is that?” said Frances, now directing
his attention towards a remarkably handsome
young man, who was riding past. The
same person was, at the same moment, pointed
out to Julia by Lord Arandale, who had been
describing the company to her. “That is,”
said the Earl, “the Marquis of H⸺. Now,
Julia,” he added, laughing; and lowering his
voice, “that would be a conquest worthy of
those beautiful eyes!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Julia scarcely perceived the person pointed
out: her beautiful eyes, as her gallant uncle was
pleased to call them, were following the figure of
our hero, as he rode with a group of other young
men. She was well accustomed to Edmund
standing before her, sitting beside her, or leaning
on the back of her chair; and, to looks and whispers,
dangerous enough in such situations; but
Edmund at a distance; and busily occupied with
other objects and other people, was something
quite new: she felt, without exactly defining
the feeling, as if he were less at her disposal
than usual; yet she thought him handsomer,
and more graceful than ever. He did look to
particular advantage; for, though a sailor, he
was very fond of riding, had learned well and
practised much when a boy, and never since
that period missed an opportunity of enjoying
an exercise in which he took great delight. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
had also, on becoming possessed of an independent
fortune, made a point of procuring
first rate horses; so that the animal he now
rode, was one of the finest on the ground.</p>

<p>While Julia was thus observing him, he singled
from the group, and gallopped across the
course at full speed; the foremost of the many
who, as usual, crowded to reach the winning-post
in time to witness the result of the heat.
“Who is it?” “Who is it?” proceeded from
numerous voices. “A Captain Montgomery,”
said one. “Captain Montgomery,” said
another. “The famous Captain Montgomery?”
enquired an elderly gentleman, “he
who behaved so well in the engagements of
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* with the
fleet under Lord Fitz-Ullin?” “The same,”
replied a second old gentleman. “How gracefully
he sits his horse!” exclaimed a young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
lady. “And did you observe,” she continued,
“when he rode by slowly a little while ago,
how very handsome he is?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I saw him at the time you speak of: he
leaned one hand on the back of the horse, and
looked up at the stand as he was passing. I
saw him bow to some ladies in the next window,”
she added, lowering her voice.</p>

<p>Here the conversation was interrupted by a
sudden exclamation of terror from Julia.</p>

<p>We left our hero galloping towards the winning
post. Henry had also been attempting
to reach the same point from another and a
nearer part of the course, and his horse had
flung him just at the moment when Edmund
came up; so that the latter’s immediately
leaping down to assist had been mistaken by
Julia for his having also fallen. Edmund heard
her exclamation, and, looking up, saw the expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
of alarm on her countenance. He
knew that he had not been in any danger,
nor was he conscious that he had appeared to
be so: he could not, consequently, take any
part of the compliment to himself. Henry’s
danger then, he thought, has been the cause
of all this agony of dread! He recollected the
emotion she had shewn the evening before,
when Sir Archibald’s violent behaviour had
threatened the safety of Henry. As he ascended
the stairs of the stand-house, Henry
followed close behind, and, the next moment,
both the young men were beside Julia. Henry
insidiously thanked her in an under tone, but
loud enough for Edmund to hear; while she,
from a consciousness of the true source of her
emotion, coloured deeply, without replying or
raising her eyes. This was not lost on poor
Edmund; neither was the look cast towards him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
by Henry, and which seemed to say, “I see you
have discovered our secret: do not betray us!”</p>

<p>The Marquis of H⸺ now rode towards
the stand; and, looking up, bowed to Lord
Arandale, who, addressing Julia in the same
jesting strain as before, said, “My poor
friend is desperately wounded! I saw it in
that one upward glance.”</p>

<p>The Marquis now entered, and on being introduced
to our heroine, established himself
near her, and began to converse with much
ease and grace, while his whole manner
evinced the liveliest admiration for his fair
companion.</p>

<p>Between the heats it is not unusual for some
of the company on the stand to indulge in the
variety of a drive round the course. The
Arandale party now prepared to do so. With
the help of a little manœuvring on the part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
of Julia; such as pretending not to hear the
Marquis’s “allow me!” and adjusting her
scarf and veil to avoid seeing his offered arm,
and totally disregarding all Henry’s speeches;
it happened that Edmund, among so many
competitors, was the fortunate individual who
handed Julia down stairs. As they descended,
she said, quite suddenly, “I thought at first,
Edmund, that you too had fallen. How glad
I was when I saw that you had only leaped
down to assist Henry!” A thrill of joy passed
through Edmund’s heart. The next moment
he was obliged to resign her to the Marquis,
who stood at the carriage door handing in
the other ladies of the party. But Edmund
was again happy! All his former sources of
affliction vanished instantaneously. It seemed
as though this last overwhelming flood of fears
had carried with it, as it ebbed, all other painful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
feelings. She did not prefer Henry to him.
She had evidently wished to show that she did
not. In this moment of inward sunshine, even
the long perspective of futurity looked bright!
Though honour now forbade his seeking the
hand of Julia; though a sense of self-respect
forbade her now listening to any avowal of his
love; his birth might yet be proved to equal
hers: and then—</p>

<p>These thoughts presented themselves to the
mind of our hero as he rode beside the Arandale
barouche, an arm leaning on the window,
conversing with Julia in the most animated manner,
to the great envy of a host of rivals, who
were riding before, behind, and beside him;
endeavouring, in vain, to introduce their horses,
heads between the spirited animal on which he
was mounted and the carriage. Whilst the
consequently unequal movements of the said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
animal, kept alive a certain interest, an ever
dawning though as often repelled anxiety on
the countenance of Julia, while she tried to
answer his remarks with perfect composure,
with which, it must be confessed, he had the
barbarity to be delighted.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord</span> Arandale, as Lord Lieutenant of the
county, took the lead in all that was going forward;
and, desirous to promote the festivity of
the scene, he gave to his numerous friends and
acquaintance the additional entertainment of a
splendid luncheon, laid in tents.</p>

<p>His lordship also made it a point with his
whole party, to dine each day at the public ordinary,
and attend the ball each evening.</p>

<p>At the door of the hotel, which furnished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the ball-room, Henry contrived to hand Julia
out of the carriage, and in consequence he
conducted her up stairs. On the way, he asked
her to dance with him. She was previously
engaged to Edmund, to the Marquis of H⸺,
to Lord Morven, and to several others; for
more sets than it was probable she should
dance during the evening. This excuse, however,
she did not take the trouble of making to
Henry, but merely told him, with firmness and
some severity of manner, that she would not
dance with him, as she felt much offended by
the style of conversation he had taken the
liberty of adopting towards her, the evening
before.</p>

<p>“I tell you what, Julia!” he replied, leading
her with much longer steps than she found
quite convenient, round the side of the room,
which was as yet unoccupied, “I know all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
your secrets, as well as if you had thought fit
to make me your confidant. I know that you
are in love (and you ought to be ashamed of
yourself) with this Edmund, this Captain Montgomery,
Captain Nobody! Although, as I told
you before, he chooses to prefer Lady Susan
Morven, forsooth, to your ladyship! You had
better get Frances to join you, I think; strip all
hands, and see who he’ll throw the apple to!
That however is your affair, but this I can tell
you, if you treat me with insult on his account,
and let such a fellow see that you do so, I
know how to be revenged! and I will be revenged!”</p>

<p>“How dare you, Henry,” said Julia, almost
breathless between indignation and mortification,
“how dare you address such language to
me! I shall let grandmamma know, and you
shall never be allowed to speak to me again!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not quite so fast, madam!” retorted Henry,
“you shall say, and you shall do what I please,
and only what I please; or, I repeat it, I’ll
have revenge!” She was about to speak again,
with a lip, the expression of which already
evinced scorn for his threats.</p>

<p>“Hear me!” he continued, preventing her,
“you are well aware, Julia, that there are subjects
which must be sore ones to Edmund. I
will thrust these upon him in the most indelicate
manner; in short, I will insult him, and
before other men too, past all endurance; till
I compel him to a quarrel, which shall end by
ending one of us! In such a case, should your
favourite escape with life, which is not very
probable, he will never be able to shew his face
again among our family.” Julia looked up,
petrified with horror and astonishment. He
answered the look, which had seemed to say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
“Is it possible?” with, “Yes! I will do it;” and
his eyes remained fixed on hers, till she shuddered
at their unshrinking expression. Yet she
felt as if compelled by some spell to continue
her gaze meeting his, and suffer him to read
every thought that was passing in her mind.</p>

<p>At length, after a painful pause, endeavouring
to assume a firmness, which she was far
from possessing, she replied, “I repeat it,
Henry. It is not to you that I shall render an
account of my conduct. For yourself—merit
toleration, (if you can,) and, for peace sake, I
will shew it you.”</p>

<p>Henry’s eyes flashed with rage for a moment,
then, bowing, he answered with a sneer,
“Lady Julia L. is pleased to condescend!”
and, looking at her insolently from head to
foot, he laughed with an expression which it
was impossible to comprehend, yet which, evidently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
had some horrible meaning; and,
snatching up her hand, he almost crushed the
delicate fingers together ere he again released
it; saying, as he did so, “Julia, you little
know what is before you! Faith, I cannot help
laughing,” he continued, “when I think how
you shall change your tone one of those days.”</p>

<p>At this moment Edmund singled from a
group at the further end of the room, and approached.
He came to claim Julia’s promised
hand for the set now forming; and Henry, for
this time, walked away without disputing it.
How gladly did she take the offered arm of our
hero; she literally clung to it. He felt her
tremble, and turned towards her with a look of
anxious enquiry. She begged him to take her
out of the room, and get her a glass of water.
No sooner had they escaped the danger of general
observation by reaching the gallery, along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
which but an occasional straggler passed, than
she burst into a passion of tears. She suffered
Edmund to take her hand, and even, unconsciously,
returned the pressure of his; as, notwithstanding
the painful suspicions renewed
by what he had just seen, he tenderly entreated
to know the cause of her tears.</p>

<p>“Do not ask me, Edmund! do not ask me!”
was all she was able to say. Edmund was confounded;
for, strange as were all the circumstances,
there was, at the moment, an unguarded
tenderness in her voice and manner, which
seemed to convey almost conclusive evidence
of attachment to himself. Yet, was it not
Henry who had caused her emotion? Edmund
had observed the deep interest with which they
had conversed; he had seen Henry take her
hand, the hand he now held; and he dropped
it at the recollection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as Julia was able, they returned to
the ball-room, Edmund again enduring all the
doubts, all the tortures of a passion, debarred
from explanation with its object.</p>

<p>They joined the set. The form of our heroine
glided along through the mazes of the
dance, and was followed by the eyes of the
enamoured Marquis of H⸺, who stood, with
folded arms, contemplating the perfection of
her figure, the unconscious grace of her movements,
the lustre and profusion of her bright
hair, the softness of her hazel eye, the mantling
glow on her cheek, and the richness and
sweet expression of her lips as they smiled,
when, from time to time, she answered or
addressed her partner; for, notwithstanding
her late agitation, she could not be Edmund’s
partner, hear his voice, and feel the kindness
of his eye, and not smile! An affection so long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
cherished as was hers, an affection which the
heart cannot do without, induces, thus, a
secret devotedness of every feeling which we
are often ashamed of even to ourselves, yet
with which we are unable to contend. In short,
Julia was already bringing her mind to contemplate,
as a species of happiness, the idea of
being even a consolation to Edmund. She determined
that when she went to her room at
night, she would ask Frances, who seemed to
be in Lady Susan’s confidence, all the particulars
about this business between her ladyship
and Edmund. He had said that he had no
hope, and therefore, at any rate, he was not
going to be married to Lady Susan. Julia
could, herself also, remain unmarried; and
then they could, according to her original plan,
love each other as friends all their lives. While
these reflections passed across the mind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Julia, the quadrille concluded, and the Marquis
lost not a moment in claiming her promised
hand for the next.</p>

<p>He had indeed, at the very first glance, been
captivated by her peculiarly luxuriant style
of beauty, and he had, subsequently, short as
had been the acquaintance, contrived to gaze
and meditate himself into a passion of the
most absurdly extravagant kind; while, not
admitting a doubt of his own success, he
made up his mind, that our heroine should
be the future Marchioness of H⸺; and,
accordingly, now led her towards the set, with
almost triumphant feelings. These, however,
being under the check of perfect good breeding,
so far from giving anything offensive to his
manners, rather served to render them animated
and agreeable. His admiration, too,
though so lately excited, was perfectly sincere;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
and as passion, however transient, while
it lasts, speaks with the irresistible voice of
nature, his mode of expressing himself could
not fail of possessing a certain charm, as he
whispered soft speeches, in terms as ardent
and unequivocal as the newness of his suit
would permit. He was not a little disappointed
therefore, at the absolute indifference, nay, almost
unconsciousness evinced by Julia’s absent
manner and languid smile; for she was thinking
of Lady Susan, of Edmund, and more
than all, of Henry’s threats, and what ought
to be her own future conduct.</p>

<p>In the course of the evening, the Marquis perceived
also, and not without some anxiety, that
he was likely to have to contend with a numerous
host of rivals; not one of them, ’tis true, was
quite his equal either in rank or fortune, but
a creature so young as Julia was, might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
disregard such considerations. He finally determined
therefore to secure Lord Arandale’s
interest, by letting him know his intentions
that very night.</p>

<p>Colonel Morven too, by this time Frances’s
declared, though by no means her received
admirer, found it not quite so easy to appropriate
her hand in the dance, or her ear at the
supper table, as he had done while none but
the family party were present. In short, the
sisters were well known to be joint heiresses
to the great estates of Lord L⸺, and, that
such were the settlements, that his lordship
could not cut off either of his daughters from
an equal share of the inheritance, even if such
daughter married in direct opposition to his
wishes. In addition to these reversionary
charms, it was equally well known, that Julia,
in a very few months, would be in actual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
possession of her Scotch estate. This property
lay in the immediate neighbourhood, its beauties
and its value were well known to all.
Both the sisters also possessed the not quite
valueless though less valuable attractions of
youth and beauty; with the charms of perfect
freedom from affectation and perfect newness
to life; for such was the seclusion in which
they had been educated, that, till very lately,
they had not only never acted a part on life’s
stage, but never been even spectators of any
scene beyond the limit of the fireside circle
at Lodore. And here, the dramatis personæ
had generally been confined to grandmamma,
Edmund, Mr. Jackson, Henry, and themselves,
the depth and continuance of Mrs. Montgomery’s
mourning of the heart having, since
the death of Lady L⸺, nearly excluded all
other society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>Can it then be wondered at, if the Ladies
L⸺, with so many circumstances in their
favour formed, to the gentlemen at least, the
centre of attraction?</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> scene of gaiety and flattery had closed
for the night. The sisters had retired to rest.
Alice and light were dismissed; and Julia commenced
her intended enquiries. But Frances
had now little information to bestow. Lady
Susan’s first confused and unconnected confidence
had been made immediately on their
return from the cottage the day before. After
they had all dressed for dinner Frances had
observed Edmund and Lady Susan conversing
for a considerable time apart. Julia also had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
observed them. From that time Lady Susan
had been an altered creature; she had not
once smiled at dinner. Julia had noticed this
also. After dinner Lady Susan had gone
alone to her cottage, where she had remained
for near an hour. On her return the traces
of tears had been visible on her countenance.
She had declined entering on the subject, and
even requested Frances, who had attempted
to introduce it, never again to mention it; and
to bury what she had already told her for ever
in her own bosom! This would certainly look
as if she either had, on reflection, thought it
prudent to retract her consent to marry Edmund,
or been required to do so by her parents.</p>

<p>How many anxious moments had Julia been
spared, could Lady Susan have brought herself
to confess that her first confidence had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
founded on error; that Edmund had never
meant to declare love for her; that she had
misunderstood him in the interview at the cottage;
and that he had sought a subsequent
one to explain, in as delicate terms as he could
devise, that his heart was devoted to another.
But no such explanation having been made to
Frances, it was not in her power to remove
her sister’s uncomfortable reflections on this
point; while, in addition, Julia had now a
new source of uneasiness: Henry’s horrid
threats having filled her mind with images of
terror, which she had neither courage nor
knowledge of the world sufficient to brave.
She must never again, she feared, venture to
reject his conspicuous, and now more than
ever hateful attentions with the spirit and decision
which her own feelings dictated. She
should be compelled henceforth to admit them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
with passiveness at least; or, might he not
require of her to receive them with seeming
pleasure. Had she not that very evening been
obliged to submit to his taking her hand from
Edmund’s arm, and leading her, with a triumphant
smile, to the dance; after she had told
Lord K., in Edmund’s hearing, that she was
too much fatigued to dance again? What
must Edmund think of this? And Henry,
she saw, had no delicacy; for he had always
taken pains to make his attentions most remarkable
when Edmund was present. Should
she complain of his conduct to her grandmamma—but
if she did, her grandmamma
could not keep him from quarrelling with Edmund—and,
besides, the subject was one upon
which, for many reasons, (unless, indeed, there
were no other means of preventing danger to
Edmund,) she should rather be silent. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
must just only therefore endeavour not to provoke
Henry’s horrid vindictive temper: though
it was so disagreeable to have him always near
her, and to have others—that is—other people
think, perhaps, that she wished it.</p>

<div class="verse">Never sleep again! My waking mis’ry</div>
<div class="verse">Were peace to this—and yet it was not sleep.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> hero, on his pillow, instead of seeking
rest from the hopes and fears, the distracting
anxieties of the day, commenced again, in fancy,
the busy scene. The undisguised admiration
of the Marquis for Julia had awakened new
terrors; his addresses would be approved of by
all her friends. Edmund shuddered to think
of the consequences to which such approval
might ultimately lead; yet imagination would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
go forward, devising new tortures, till he
leaped from his bed, threw open his window,
and strove to force his thoughts into some
other channel.</p>

<p>The remembrance of the mysterious understanding
which seemed to exist between
Julia and Henry, next arose like a spectre,
and laid its icy grasp on every warm fibre of
his heart. The pang, however, was but momentary;
this subject had not yet fastened on
each faculty, with the withering, lasting hold
it was one day destined to possess. It was reserved
for time and absence to weaken the
blissful, internal evidence, derived from look,
voice, manner; and to strengthen into certainty
and misery every vague suspicion to
which any untoward coincidence had ever given
birth. At present, the very circumstances necessarily
connected with such suspicions, led,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
by the association of ideas, to a vivid recollection
of some of the latest, and strongest proofs
of tenderness, he had himself ever received from
Julia. He now dwelt on these, till he yielded
again to the delightful hope, that she really
loved him, although she had thought it necessary
to check his mad declaration of a passion,
which could never meet with the sanction of
her father. If then she loved him, surely she
would not marry another! No, she would reject
this Marquis of H⸺? And, as to Henry,
she must have rejected him already! The emotion
she had shown when conversing apart with
him, must have been occasioned by regret at
being obliged to give pain. He therefore returned
to his pillow, and busied himself in recalling
every look, every word, on which his
hopes of being secretly beloved were founded.
Fear and doubt vanished, and fancy, for a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
blissful moments, pictured the realization of all
his hopes.</p>

<p>But hope, on such a subject, was not consistent
with honour, with duty—how then
could a virtuous mind cling to it with unalloyed
felicity. Conscience spoke, and demanded a
sacrifice!—a sacrifice which the heart knew not
how to yield! His secret wishes now seemed
his accusers; and dear as they had long been, he
next strove to deny, even to himself, their actual
existence. But the compromise was not
accepted; still conscience repeated, that it was
his duty to fly a temptation, which he evidently
had not strength to resist. Should the discovery
of his birth never be made; or, when
made, should it not prove such as to give him
pretensions to Julia’s hand; was it consistent
with honour and right feeling, that he
should, during the period of uncertainty, endeavour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
to gain her affections—perhaps succeed
in so doing! But this thought again bewildered,
again left him incapable of a rational reflection,
or a right resolve.</p>

<p>Such is the mental warfare, such the wild
rebellion of will, which lays waste the peace of
him, who suffers the voice of passion to mingle
in the counsels of conscience.</p>

<p>Edmund slept; still undecided, and in his
dreams endured once more a recapitulation of
each anxious feeling, and unfinished conflict.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the sisters were descending to breakfast,
Frances returned up stairs for some violets
which Alice had with great difficulty procured
for her, and which she had forgotten on her
dressing table, while Julia proceeded towards
a room their party had occupied the evening
before. But on entering and perceiving Henry
seated alone reading a newspaper, and no appearance
of even preparation for breakfast, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
was about to retire. “You may as well stay
where you are, I think,” said Henry. “If it
was Edmund that was here you would not be
in such a hurry to make off.” Fearful of irritating
him after his alarming threats of last
night, poor Julia directed her steps to the
furthest removed window, and stood looking
out. Henry continued reading for some time.
Edmund’s voice was heard in the hall calling
to a favourite dog. Henry suddenly rose, approached
Julia, knelt on one knee before her,
and took her hand. She was surprised; for,
when alone with her, he was not in the habit
of troubling her with any affectation of tenderness;
and she was particularly sorry that
he had chosen the present moment. Before
she could remonstrate, or succeed in disengaging
her hand, she heard footsteps; and,
looking up, saw Edmund advancing along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
gallery towards the door, which she had left
open for the purpose of rendering her unwilling
interview with Henry as little of a
private one as possible. Our hero looked into
the room, hesitated for a moment, and retired.
Henry, after throwing a glance over his shoulder,
rose carelessly, and, without taking the
trouble of explaining his late movement, looked
out of the window and whistled. Julia,
with tears starting to her eyes, at length assuming
courage, said: “Henry, I will not
endure this persecution! I will complain to
grandmamma, and write to my father too;
and you shall not be allowed either to trouble
me, or to—to—injure any body else.”</p>

<p>“You had better, I think,” he replied,
“publish to the world your disgraceful attachment
to a beggarly upstart—and who, to
do him justice, has not sought it. And, as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
either Lord L⸺, (if he were at home,) or
my aunt not allowing me to quarrel with Edmund,
(which is, of course, what you mean by—injuring
any body else,)” mocking her voice
and the hesitation of her manner, “I’d be
glad to know how they’d prevent it? I may
be called to account afterwards, you think;
but I’ve told you before, and I tell you again,
that, if I am provoked, no consideration for
consequences shall prevent my being revenged
at all hazards. As to your ever marrying me
or not, you may please yourself; but I shall
take devilish good care——”</p>

<p>“You know very well, Henry,” she interrupted,
now speaking firmly and scornfully in
spite of all her fears, “I never will marry
you!”</p>

<p>“I know no such thing!” he rejoined, with
a repetition of the laugh and the look which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
the evening before had made her shudder, and
which now again caused her blood to run cold.
“But I know this,” he continued, “that you
shall never marry Edmund; and further, that
I will not be openly insulted with impunity;
nor will I suffer such a fellow, forsooth, to
triumph over me! So hate me in your heart,
if you choose; but, at your peril, (or rather
at his peril,) show it before him! Recollect
that hanging me, (if you could do it,) won’t
restore him to life after I have blown his brains
out! Your mother little thought,” he continued,
insolently opposing the attempt she
was now making to escape his presence by
standing between her and the doorway, “your
mother little thought, I say, when she brought
in the beggar brat, and washed him, that she
was preparing a husband for her eldest daughter!—the
Lady Julia L⸺!—heiress to thirty-three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
thousand per annum! Worth taking
better care of than that, faith! A windfall for
his betters, I can tell him!” Julia could listen
no longer: she passed him with a determined
effort, and literally fled from the apartment,
with, however, the loss of a scarf which Henry
caught at as she was departing. Thus concluded
poor Julia’s last struggle for liberty:
henceforward she never dared to disobey or
disoblige her insolent cousin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">“Have</span> you any commands to Mrs. Montgomery,

party were engaged at a larger one with breakfast.</p>

<p>“Oh yes!” said Lord Arandale. “Pray tell

indeed that I shall go there myself, after the
races.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>Julia and Frances now entered.</p>

<p>Shortly after, rising and going towards Edmund,
he bent over the table and said, in an under
tone, “I wish you would just tell my sister
(it will save me a letter, and I am much hurried)
that the Marquis of H⸺ has declared his
intention of making proposals for Julia, (in
due time,) and that, I think she had better
write to Lord L⸺. I wish he could be at
home. Yet, the connexion is so very eligible
that all unnecessary delays should be avoided.
Julia’s own pretensions, in fact, rank so high,
that the peerage affords few that can be termed
equal matches for her. Her affections cannot
be pre-engaged?” he added, in a sort of consulting
whisper. “Henry behaves very foolishly;
but, I should hope, there was no attachment
on her side. The thing, however, must
be put an end to!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Arandale returned to the breakfast
table, and left our hero, as he supposed, writing.
Julia was the only person who observed
that he remained in the very same attitude,
and without the slightest motion, till the carriages
drove up. She contrived in the general
move, to pass near the table at which he sat,
where, pausing a moment, she said, “Are
you writing to grandmamma, Edmund?”</p>

<p>He had been quite pale when she first approached,
and evidently had not observed her.
He started at the sound of her voice, and looked
at her without appearing to comprehend the
purport of her enquiry, but made no reply.
“Are you writing to grandmamma?” she repeated,
“because, I wish——” He examined
his paper two or three times from top to bottom,
and then replied, “I—was—”</p>

<p>Henry came up at the moment, and, offering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
to Julia his arm, which she now dare not refuse,
hurried her to the carriage. She perceived,
with much vexation, that he wore,
drawn across his breast, the scarf he had
snatched from her. He continued, in defiance
of a whispered remonstrance on her part, to
sport it for some hours. He knew that Edmund
was well aware to whom the scarf belonged.
At length, Lord Arandale perceiving what was
going on, insisted on the scarf being resigned.
The Earl restored it himself to Julia, with a
reproachful glance; to which she replied, that
the scarf had been both taken and worn without
her permission.</p>

<p>“Men seldom take liberties they do not
expect will, at least, be pardoned,” replied his
lordship, with some severity of countenance.</p>

<p>Why Henry should be thus anxious to have
it supposed that he was acceptable to Julia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
while he took so little pains to become really
so, is a mystery which time only can solve.</p>

<p>Our hero did not appear on the stand that
day; although he was seen riding at a distance
on the course. At the ordinary he went in to
dinner without taking charge of any lady. At
the ball, indeed, he was again to be found near
Julia. After a few languid attempts at conversation,
however, he seated himself beside
her in perfect silence, till the Marquis of H⸺
coming towards them with a gay and delighted
air, claimed her hand for the first set. She
stood up to dance, and Edmund almost immediately
left the room.</p>

<p>When Edmund retired that night to his own
apartment he took himself severely to task: he
could assuredly acquit himself of deliberate
efforts, intentions, or even wishes to gain Julia’s
affections beyond the limit of friendship; yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
he had in every moment of temptation yielded
to intoxicating hopes; and to attempt to distinguish
between such hopes and wilful wishes
he found was mere sophistry: he determined
therefore to fly without again beholding Julia.
As yet, her innocent heart believed all its feelings
friendship. She would think him unkind,
ungrateful, and forget him, without suffering
any of those terrible contentions of spirit which
he endured. He dare not sleep, lest he should
awake under the dominion of a less virtuous
impulse.</p>

<p>Without therefore retiring to bed, even for
an hour, he commenced instantly and hastily
his preparations for departure, confusedly
ruminating the while:—What was he about to
do? Could he leave Julia thus, to the persecutions
of Henry, to the persuasions of the
Marquis? and he drew his leg out of the boot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
into which it had been half way introduced.—But
he was confident, he told himself once more,
for the hundredth time, that she had already
rejected Henry, and that she would reject the
Marquis of H⸺. His foot again entered the
boot top, and, now, completed its descent.</p>

happened to perceive a gap in the boundaries
of the high road, which particularly caught his
eye, as it not a little resembled the approach to
the race-course. He turned in accordingly on
a rugged piece of moorland, and looked about
him. Nor right, nor left, nor straight before,
offered other prospect than a wide extent of
close cropped sod, plentifully sprinkled with
loose stones, and diversified here and there by
pools of water and patches of heath; the horizon
every where the only visible boundary;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
while on the extreme edge of this monotonous
waste, the just risen sun stood in lonely majesty.</p>

<p>Uninteresting as all this may appear, it
seemed to please Bucephalus mightily: he
made wide his nostrils, snuffed the morning air,
twice swung his neck, to try the length of his
rein, and then set out at full speed. The road,
or rather path he took, pursued a gradual ascent
for some time, when suddenly the spirited
animal stopped short and snorted, on which,
Edmund perceived that he had reached the
brow of a hill, or rather edge of a precipice;
whence, looking down an abrupt and wooded
descent, a valley presented itself, far below,
possessing a species of beauty in some respects
peculiar to the spot. A small river or rivulet,
ran close beneath the overhanging cliffs which
formed the opposite side of the valley. Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
stream varied in breadth; its banks were rugged
and irregular, while its course frequently
divided and reunited, forming many of the
most picturesque spots, into little islets. On
most of these, as well as on many projecting
points of the bank, stood, what, from this distance
at least, had the appearance of ruined
towers: some round, some square, all moss
grown; some bearing small trees on their
summits, and in the crevices of their sides,
and almost all having their own large old tree
or trees, standing close to them. The grassy
carpet of the vale was of a green peculiarly vivid.
The opposite cliffs were thickly wooded in
every aperture; while, here and there, smooth
brows of good pasture land, dotted with grazing
cattle, appeared on their summits. The valley
at one end opened on an extent of flat country,
terminated by a distant chain of mountains;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
at the other it admitted a view of the
sea, discernible between two bold headlands,
the furthest and highest of which was crowned
by a single tower, that appeared destined to
reign over all those more humbly situated in
the vale beneath. Tempted by the beauty of
the prospect, though not sufficiently acquainted
with the country to know where he now was,
Edmund directed his horse to take a rather
dangerous looking, very narrow road, which
by running along the side of the precipice,
lessened the steepness of the footing, while it
promised to lead him into the midst of the
region he had thus been for some moments
contemplating.</p>

<p>As he gradually drew nearer and nearer the
curious scene that lay beneath him, and, at
length, accomplishing his perilous descent,
entered the valley itself, and approached those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
objects which he had at first thought were numerous
ruins, they in general began to assume
somewhat of a different appearance, and,
finally, on coming up to each, to his great surprise
as well as disappointment, they one by
one, proved to be but deep sided, perpendicular
rocks; looking, however, as ancient as though
they had in the time of Noah, resisted the retiring
waters of the flood, when all more yielding
substances had been borne along the narrow
channel of the glen, into the sea.</p>

<p>He now crossed the river by means of a single
arched bridge, much overhung by the trees
of the opposite bank, under the thick cover of
which it immediately led. Through this copse
he rode for a time and then emerged just at the
foot of the headland, the lofty summit of which
bore on high that which he could now ascertain
to be the only real tower of all he had in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
imagination so designated. Rock over rock,
with wood between, shelved and projected, till
how the building itself was to be reached seemed
an impenetrable mystery; there did not appear
to be nearly space enough to conquer so perpendicular
an ascent by any windings of the
road he still pursued. He next passed a lodge-gate,
which was opened by a little bare-footed
girl, who stretched first the one side on its
hinges, then the other, though our hero had
meanwhile passed through. At a second gate
he demanded if he might pursue his course
through what thus seemed to be an approach
to some nobleman’s or gentleman’s place,
though, as yet, he could discern no residence.
He was answered in the affirmative, and proceeded
till, having got round to the further side
of the headland, a part of the height of which
he had meantime, by a gradual ascent, achieved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
he came suddenly in view of a magnificent
castellated mansion, apparently surrounded
by an extensive richly wooded and beautifully
diversified demesne, some of the grounds of
which, on one side, descended by an inclined
plane to the sea, and the whole of which had
been screened from view during the former part
of his ride by the much greater height of the
side nearest the valley, on the rocky pinnacle
of which, at an elevation far above that of the
castle, and surrounded up to its very base by
wood, still appeared conspicuous the same single
tower which from the first had attracted so
much of his notice. Seeing a lad on the lawn,
who was employed rolling the newly mown
grass, Edmund gave him his horse, demanding
to whom the place belonged, and if the family
were at home? The lad first stared awkwardly,
and when about to reply was prevented doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
so, coherently, by the unruly movements of the
animal committed to his charge. Our hero,
however, on ascertaining that the family was
not at home, without waiting to repeat the former
part of his question, turned into a footpath
among the trees, which promised to lead in the
direction of the said solitary tower.</p>

<p>He soon found himself in a maze of gravel
walks and abrupt turnings, the ascent so steep
as to be often indispensably assisted by flights
of irregular stone steps. On each shelf of the
rock, lately so much above his head, his feet now
found a path; though one secured from the precipice
only by a superabundant growth of shrubs.
On the side of the cliff immediately over the
sea it was sometimes quite terrific to peep
through the slender defences of a honeysuckle
or jessamine at the foaming billows dashing
in far below on a wild and rocky beach. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
length arrived at the goal of all his labours, he
entered the long seen, and, at a distance, formidable-looking
tower, and found it fitted up
within as a conservatory and well supplied with
exotics in full bloom. Of these he plucked,
mechanically, a few of the finest blossoms, then
sighed and desisted, as the remembrance smote
on his heart that he could not now, as he had
been wont, present them to Julia. He thrust,
however, those he had collected into his own
bosom; he could not throw away what had once
been, even in thought, associated with her. Near
this building the last of the shelving paths tapered
off gradually, till there was no longer footing.
The rock rose behind it more than perpendicularly—it
overhung; while, in front, there
was now no defence whatever, not a shrub, not
so much as a tuft of grass, or even moss, to break
the treacherous surface of the polished flint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>On the furthest portion which it was possible
to occupy of this perilous spot, was placed a
rustic seat; on this Edmund flung himself,
and rested his eyes with a peculiarly desolate
feeling on his old friends and companions, the
waves of the sea. They seemed pressing after
each other, and all, as it were, crowding towards
the foot of the steep cliff from the summit
of which he thus viewed them. He smiled
bitterly: to his distempered fancy they appeared
hastening forward to welcome his return
amongst them, with a fierce and boisterous
species of delight, very uncongenial to the
softer emotions in which he had of late so
much too frequently indulged.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he ejaculated, “the bosom of the deep
is indeed my only home! the wide waste of
waters my comfortless domain! To spread desolation
around me with fire and with sword! to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
bring death and misery in my train! to send destruction
and despair in the whirlwind before me!
these are my daily duties! these my domestic
joys!” He paused, then proceeded: “If once
there were—friends of the friendless—those
who—could—could pity—fate has torn them
from me! Nay worse—I must tear myself
from them! I must seem ungrateful, unkind—I
must teach those who might have loved—to
forget me—or—be a villain!” He hastened to
add, for certain words in the last sentence were
shaking his best resolutions. “Yes, a villain!”
he repeated. “Is he less who, wrapped in
mystery, without a name, without a home,
without a country, would ensnare the innocent
affections of one unknowing of the world, unable
as yet to judge what may one day be her
own appreciation of its honours or even of
its prejudices?” After a moment’s pause he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
pronounced firmly, “I must never see her
more!”</p>

<p>He now sunk back in perfect supineness.
All the purposes of existence seemed at an end
for him. By his own free will act, he had
quitted love and happiness for ever. He felt
every power of resistance weakened by the
supernatural effort. The image of Julia, hallowed,
endeared, like that of a departed friend,
presented itself in a new, and, if possible, tenderer
light. Were he now, he thought, to
behold that smile again, where would be the
restraints of duty? Forgotten! Utterly forgotten
in the tumultuous joy of such a moment!
And had such felicity been his but yesterday?—Good
heavens! yesterday!—And now!——</p>

<p>Fatigued by contending thoughts, he now
strove not to think at all; at length, as he lay in
the reclining position, induced by the languor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
despondency, the dashing of the waves began
to sound more distant than before, and a slender
creeping plant, which hung from the rock
immediately above his head, was, during momentary
and flitting visions, mistaken for some
part of the rigging of a ship, and then seen no
more. In fact, not having been in bed the
night before, and having, ever since, suffered
great agony of mind, he was now so completely
exhausted, that a sort of torpor was gradually
taking possession of his senses.</p>

<p>This, after some time, deepened into a sound
and refreshing sleep, which lasted for several
hours. Towards the end of his protracted
slumber, our hero began to dream that he was
in heaven. Yet, sublimely as he had sometimes
conceived of the glories of that abode of
the blessed, he could see nothing but clear sky
every where; not even the angels, though he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
heard them singing, (one of Julia’s songs too,)
and, precisely with her voice. The voice ceased;
and then the general music of the spheres
seemed to arise all round him! By degrees he
became sensible that the music was real; and
that his eyes, which had been for some seconds
partly open, were gazing upwards at the bright
blue sky, which from the circumstance of his
lying on his back, was necessarily unvaried by
any other object. He started to his feet a
little too suddenly, considering the dangerous
position he occupied, and of the particular
nature of which he had, at the moment, no
precise recollection. Fortunately, however,
being uncommonly active, by a powerful effort,
and a snatch at the creeping plant before mentioned,
he was enabled to recover his balance.
He observed where he was, called to mind the
wanderings which had brought him there, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
acknowledged to himself, that he must have
slept. So far mysteries were cleared up. But
the music he still heard, and now he assuredly
was awake! He walked a little way, in various
directions, in the hope of discovering the musicians;
but from the effect produced by the
circular form of the rock, the occasional waftings
of the breeze, and the mazy labyrinth of
the paths, it was impossible for him to decide
whether he approached, or retreated from the
sounds.</p>

<p>After descending, however, till he was two
or three shelves lower, it became evident that
the swell of wind instruments was fuller, though
still he could not tell in what direction it came.
While listening to discover this, his ear caught
the hum of voices. He moved on, it became
more distinct; and through it he could even
distinguish the very uncelestial sound of knives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
and forks clanking on plates. Edmund, notwithstanding,
felt something like a responding
inward emotion; for he had not yet breakfasted,
and it was now two o’clock.</p>

<p>He still moved on, and now the noise of the
voices, &amp;c. seemed to arise, actually from below
the spot on which he stood. He performed
a species of pirouette, looking the very
personification of bewilderment. Then stood
some seconds motionless. Then, as though
smitten by a sudden inspiration, pushed his
head and one shoulder through the tangled
clusters of an interposing honeysuckle; and,
holding firmly with the contrary arm, around
the slender and yielding trunk of a young
mountain ash, about which the flowery screen
had entwined itself, he leaned forward, and
beheld, on a broad part of the shelf or terrace
of rock next below the one on which he himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
stood, a long luncheon table, with a large
company seated at it. Crowns of hats, cauls
of bonnets, and figures, foreshortened to excess,
afforded no very sure criterion by which to
ascertain whether or not any of the party were
known to him. The voices too, were so blended
with each other, and with the music, and
with the aforesaid clanking, that they brought
no certainty of any thing; yet, as he looked
and listened, he could not divest himself of the
idea, that all was familiar to his eye, and to his
ear. While impelled by increasing curiosity, he
strained forward in rather an imprudent manner,
one of the blossoms which he had collected in
the conservatory, and placed loosely within the
breast of his coat, now, assisted by his bending
attitude, found its way out, and descending
lightly as a thistle-down, rested on the bosom
of a lady, who immediately lifted up her face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
to see whence it came. What was Edmund’s
astonishment, when he saw the features of
Julia; and what was hers, when she, so unexpectedly,
beheld Edmund in his most strange
and perilous situation, hanging over her very
head. She pronounced his name, and continued
looking up, with as much terror as surprise,
till the whole company following the
direction of her eyes, with one accord, gazed
upwards.</p>

<p>A general roar of laughter proceeded from
the men; and several pretty little screams
from the ladies.</p>

<p>“Leap it, Edmund!” cried Henry. “Oh,
don’t! don’t!” involuntarily exclaimed Julia.
“I wonder if he could!” said Frances, looking
half amused, and half alarmed.</p>

<p>“How funny it would be!” cried the Misses
Morven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>“Take the path to the right, Montgomery,
and come down to us,” said Lord Arandale.
Edmund disappeared from above, and, in a few
minutes, joined the party below. He made his
way immediately to Julia and Frances, who
each extended a hand to him at the same time,
making room for him between them. “This
is unexpected happiness, indeed!” he said, as
he sprang into the offered seat. He looked
delighted, he even laughed, though hysterically,
as he trembled from head to foot, with uncontrollable
emotion.</p>

<p>“You know where you are, I suppose,
Montgomery?” said the Earl. “Not I,” answered
Edmund, “further than that my present
situation is a very enviable one!” This he
said with an air of light gallantry, which concealed
tolerably well both the reality and the
extravagance of his feelings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>“You do not know then that this place is
the Craigs?” rejoined the Earl. “We are all
here to day, for the express purpose of displaying
its beauties to Julia and Frances, who
have never had an opportunity of visiting it
before. We are to attempt the top of the rock,
as soon as we have fortified ourselves by
luncheon.”</p>

<p>“I have seen many of its beauties,” he replied,
“but without knowing where I was.
My horse, in fact, brought me here this morning,
while I was thinking of something else.”
Then, too much confounded to talk any thing
but nonsense, and too much exhilarated to be
silent, he addressed Julia, enquiring if she
were aware that the building on the top of the
rock was a conservatory. She replied in the
negative.</p>

<p>“Allow me then,” he rejoined, with seeming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
playfulness, but breathless from agitation,
“allow me to be the first to present you with an
offering of its sweets!” As he spoke, he took
the remainder of the flowers from his bosom,
and gave them to Julia; experiencing, at the
moment, an indescribable delight in reversing,
as it were, the feeling with which he had
placed them there. This was mere trifling;
but such was the effect on Edmund’s spirits of
all this happiness restored, and without any
fault of his too, just at the very moment when
he had resigned it all, that, under the intoxicating
sense of the present pleasure, he scarcely
knew what he said or did; or how sufficiently
to enjoy so much felicity while it
lasted; for through it all there was a vaguely
recognised idea, that it must pass away. Julia
took the flowers with a smile, not at all calculated
to sober Edmund’s transports, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
placed them (of course without thinking what
she was doing,) in so enviable a situation, that
they were followed by the eyes of our hero,
and gazed upon, as their delicate blossoms
visibly vibrated to each pulsation of Julia’s
heart, till he wished himself, not “a glove
upon that hand,” but a fair blossom, &amp;c.</p>

<p>“We are very much obliged to your horse,
Captain Montgomery,” said Lady Arandale,
“as it is to him, it seems, we owe the pleasure
of your company; and now we shall certainly
not allow you to escape again till after our
ball.” Edmund bowed assent. Several of the
party asked him if, in his wanderings, he had
discovered the bower of the concealed musicians.
He described how much they had
puzzled his researches. Julia told him (and
her voice, which so lately he had scarcely
hoped to hear again, thrilled through his heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
as she spoke the unimportant words) that this
had all been contrived by Lord Arandale, as an
agreeable surprise; that his lordship had privately
sent on musicians, directions to the
housekeeper, &amp;c.; and then, when they were
all on the way between *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and Arandale,
he had, very innocently, proposed that they
should look at the Craigs, as it lay but a
couple of miles from the direct road.</p>

<p>“I dare say,” said Frances, “that Edmund
was in the secret, and that he just came on before
to be a part of the surprise.”</p>

<p>Julia looked at him to see if this were true,
but the question her eyes had intended to ask
was forgotten, something in the expression of
his producing a sad confusion of ideas just at
the moment.</p>

<p>“I am sure he surprised me in a most especial
manner,” drawled out Lady Morven.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
“And quite astounded me,” said Graham, in
exactly the same tone. “Forgetting, I was
not the fortunate tenant of a repose chair, I
had a narrow escape of falling through this jessamine,
and going over the immeasurable cliff!”</p>

<p>“Fye, don’t talk so, you creature,” said
Lady Morven.</p>

<p>“I was more surprised than any one else,
I am sure,” said Miss Morven; “if I had not
caught hold of this rose bush, and pricked all
my fingers, I should certainly have gone over!”</p>

<p>“And I, if it had not been for this sweet-briar,
that has scratched all the back of my
neck!”</p>

<p>“And I, only for this honeysuckle, though
one branch broke off, and frightened me so!”</p>

<p>“And I, I’m sure, if Mr. Gordon had not
just put out his arm and saved me!” Thus
had all the Misses Morven escaped. “The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
ladies mean, that Captain Montgomery is the
most agreeable part of the surprise,” said the
Earl, good humouredly. The Misses Morven
tittered assent. Frances questioned him as to
how his joining them had really happened.</p>

<p>He gave as circumstantial an account of his
morning adventure as the flutter of his spirits
would permit. When he described the situation
of his late <i lang="fr">couche</i>, and how he had started
to his feet, without remembering where he was,
Lady Arandale seriously reprimanded him for
his thoughtlessness. All the Misses Morven
were clamorous; Lady Morven said he might
really have fallen on the centre of the luncheon
table, and frightened them all to death! Frances
scolded him with tears in her eyes. Julia
alone did not speak, but she looked round,
became pale, and the next moment red. The
blood rushed from and to the heart of Edmund<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
with a corresponding ebb and flow. After a
pause, as though to change the too engrossing
subject, thus implied by the silence of both, he
asked her abruptly, if she had sung since she
had been at the Craigs? One song had been
attempted, at Lady Arandale’s particular request,
to try the effect of an echo.</p>

<p>Luncheon ended, the whole party proceeded
towards the handsome castellated mansion
already mentioned, to view the fine collection
of pictures it contained.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> left our party crossing the now well rolled
lawn towards the house.</p>

<p>On their arrival at the great door, which
was open, a strange scene presented itself
in the entrance-hall, in the centre of which
stood a short fat gentleman looking with
much astonishment at a little thin old woman,
who, from her long, tapering, stomachered
waist occupying one half of her
height, her full petticoats spreading like a
hoop; her short sleeves and mittens; her hair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
white as though it were powdered, drawn up
over a high sugar-loaf shaped cushion, and
her small cap on the top of all—resembled
much one of the figures in the frontispiece of
an old play book. Her diminutive features had
nothing remarkable about them, but the little
reddish knob or button at the end of her nose,
which seemed placed there expressly to support
her spectacles. These, in visible hurry
and trepidation, she was adjusting with one
hand, while, with the other, she was grasping
the fat gentleman’s arm, and, at the same time,
exclaiming as with looks of terrified amazement
she scanned his appearance, “Ye dinna
pretend to tell me, sir, that ye are Maister
Lauson!” The fat gentleman affirmed that
he certainly was Mr. Lauson. The little
woman seemed of opinion that she knew better,
and maintained that he was not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>The advance of the entering party, and the
Earl, addressing the fat gentleman by the
name of Lauson, seemed to complete the dismay
of poor Mrs. M’Kinley, the housekeeper,
for such was the name, and such the quality of
the little woman. “Lauson! Lauson! Lauson!”
she reiterated, clasping her hands,
“wha iver heerd o’ sick a thing!—Jean!” she
cried next, “Jean! Jean! Jean! Some on
ye caw Jean!” A hard-working looking
woman entered. “Hear ye to that, Jean!”
said Mrs. M’Kinley, “hear ye to that! yon
Maister Lauson! Heard ye iver the like o’
that?”</p>

<p>“Yon short gentleman?” enquired Jean,
as soon as her awkward courtesies to our party
were over. “Nay, yon’s nane o’ Maister
Lauson. Maister Lauson’s a taw weel lookt
gentleman, no’ the least like yon gentleman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>“Tall or short I am Mr. Lauson,” said
Lauson very sulkily, for the Messrs Morven
had laughed out, and the Misses Morven were
tittering evidently at his expense.</p>

<p>Lord Arandale desired there might be no
more noise, assuring Mrs. M’Kinley that the
gentleman, whose identity she seemed so unwilling
to admit, not only was, beyond a doubt,
Mr. Lauson, but that he was at the Craigs
that day by his, the Earl’s, particular desire,
to give him the meeting for the arrangement
of some business respecting serious repairs,
which he understood the park walls required.</p>

<p>“Now, madam,” said Lauson, “you’ll not
dispute my Lord’s word, I hope.”</p>

<p>“Yeer no going to tell me,” exclaimed Mrs.
M’Kinley, looking wilder than ever, “that
yon was the deevil at cam here and cawd
himsel Maister Lauson, and brought my ain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
keys we him, and my ain lables on them, and
took aw the things awa we him!”</p>

<p>“As to its being the devil,” replied Lauson,
“I shall not dispute that; but it certainly was
not Mr. Lauson.”</p>

<p>“What can she mean?” said the Earl.</p>

<p>“And did ye send naybody then?” eagerly
demanded the poor woman. On being fully
assured that no person whatever had been
sent to the Craigs, or authorized in any way
to demand of her any thing of which she had
the charge, “Then,” she cried, first clasping
her hands for a moment, then flinging her
arms to their utmost extent asunder, “aw is
gane—gane—rifled—robbed—lost—ther’s naything
left in aw the hoose!”</p>

<p>An explanation was called for. Mrs. M’Kinley
flung herself on her knees in the midst of
the hall, and, calling on heaven and Jean to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
witness the truth of all she should say, after
much that was too incoherent to relate, gave
the following account, though more frequently
interrupted by her hearers than it is necessary
to notice.</p>

<p>“It was a fine moonlight night aboot a
month syne, and I was sitting at the window
o’ the hooskeeper’s room, (it looks front, ye
ken,) and I catched a glympse o’ some-ot like
tle a carriage coming roond the hill. I could
na credit my ain een, so I looked again, and it
turned in among the trees. Weel, said I to
Jean, wha can be coming tle this lone place at
this time o’ night? It’s a while yet till the
young mistress be at age; and I’m no expecting
that ony o’ the femely will com’ doon
afoor then, if they com’ then it sel. Ye mind
that, Jean?” “Weel enough,” said Jean.
“The carriage,” continued Mrs. M’Kinley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
“for it was a carriage sure enough, com’ oot
o’ the wood again, and sweeped along the
lawn, and up it com’ to the door, and ain o’
the sarving men, (for there were twa,) jumped
doon and made sick a thundering rap as gar’d
the hale hoose resound; the t’other man jumped
doon, and opened the carriage door——”</p>

<p>“But what has all this to do, my good woman,”
interrupted the Earl, “with the house
being, as you say, rifled and robbed? The
robbers did not drive up to the hall door in
their carriage, I suppose!” “Aye, bit they
did, tho’!” cried Mrs. M’Kinley, wildly. “Bit
hear me oot,” she continued, “hear me oot, I
say! and then dee what ye will wee me!
Weel, I hasted roond, and was standing i’ the
haw, by the time the hoose door was opened.
A taw, weel-looked, vara weel-dressed, elderly
gentleman gits oot o’ the carriage, and coms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
intle the haw in a great bustle, cawing oot wid
a lood voice, ‘I hope you have got fires there!’
Then he hurries up tle ain o’ the parlour doors,
and, finding it locked, he turns roond angrily,
saying, ‘How is this! Where is Mrs. M’Kinley?’
What was I to think o’ sick impudence,
if he was no Mr. Lauson himsel?” Here the
young men had another laugh at Lauson. “I
stood forward,” continued Mrs. M’Kinley,
“and courtesied tle him. ‘What is the reason
you have not things in some order, madam?’
said he. I was no expeckin ony body, sir,
said I. ‘Did you not receive my letter from
Keswick, ordering you to have things in readiness?’
No sir, I answered, I had no accounts
since my last remettance from Mr.
Lauson. ‘Very odd,’ said he, ‘however,
here! open these doors! and get fires immediately
in one of the rooms—whichever is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
most comfortable. And, d’i hear, send in coffee—I
hope you have got something in the
house for supper?’ There is a lettle cold
meat, sir, said I. ‘That won’t do,’ sais
he, ‘you must get something hot.’ You can
have a foul, sir, said I. You mind picking
the foul, Jean? ‘Aye, to be sure,’ said Jean.
And so he’d have the foul,” continued Mrs.
M’Kinley, “‘And take care,’ he sais, ‘you
have a well-aired bed, and have a good fire
made in my room immediately—and, here!
come back!’ for I was going, ‘when I have
had coffee, do you attend me here for further
orders!’ For, before this,” continued Mrs.
M’Kinley, “I had opened one of the parlours for
him, and followed him in. ‘You know, I suppose,
that I am Mr. Lauson?’ he said. No, sir,
said I, I did not know it before, sir. ‘Well you
know it now, ma’am,’ he said.” The young men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
laughed. “And wha could misgee the words
o’ a gentleman wha took se mickle upon him!”
said Mrs. M’Kinley, with an appealing, but
still wild look at the fairer part of her audience,
“and sae I did as I was bidden, and when his
sarving men had brought oot the coffee things,
I went in for my orders. He was standing
wide on the hearth-stane, we his back tle the
fire, and his twa hands in the pockets o’ his
breeks, haudding aside his parted coat, for a’
the warld like lord and maister e the hoose.”</p>

<p>“He then talt me,” continued Mrs. M’Kinley,
“that he had com doon tle see safely removed
the plate, coins, books, pictures, &amp;c. &amp;c.”</p>

<p>“The devil he did!” cried Lauson.</p>

<p>“But of course, you did not let him touch
any thing?” said the Earl.</p>

<p>“Hear me oot! Hear me oot!” exclaimed
Mrs. M’Kinley, deriving courage from despair.
“They were to be aw removed, he said, tle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
the hoose in toon, that was preparing and furnishing,
again Lady Julia should be at age—”</p>

<p>“What an audacious villain!” exclaimed the
Earl. “But you did not, I say, allow him to
remove any thing?”</p>

<p>“Every thing! Every thing!” cried Mrs.
M’Kinley, with vehemence: “didna I tell yee,
awe was gane thegether? And I helped to pack
them mysel’!”</p>

<p>“Why, woman, you must have been mad!”
said his lordship. “Mad or not mad,” she
replied, “I’ve geen him every thing! Sae hear
me oot, and then, as I said afoor, di what ye
will we me! I desarve hanging, and I can git
ne war!”</p>

<p>“Well, well! say on, say on,” said the Earl.</p>

<p>“If I geid up the things in good order,” she
continued, “he wad gee me, he said, receipts
for every thing; mentioning that they were
so, that I might no be accountable for ony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
damage the things might sustain i’ the carriage.
And he said further, that to avoid the
chafing o’ land carriage, aw was tle gang by
long sea, in a vessel whilk was now aff the
coast. Bit what maist of aw convinced me,
at he could be nebody else bit Maister Lauson,
was, at he took oot on his port mantle, aw the
keys o’ the hoose.”—“The keys?” interrupted
the Earl. “False ones, of course,” said
Lauson.</p>

<p>“Na sick a thing,” she rejoined, “bit the
vara keys themsel and labeled, as I mysel had
labeled them, when I geed them tle yeer lordship
and Maistriss Montgomery: sae, what
was I te think? Nor did the steward, nor the
gairdinir, nor the gamkeeper, at sleeped i’ the
hoose for security, iver think o’ misdooting at
the gintleman was Maister Lauson.”</p>

<p>“A pretty business indeed,” ejaculated Lauson.
“A very serious one, I begin to fear!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
said the Earl. “A very unlikely one” said
Lauson, rattling something in his pocket as he
spoke. “But come, madam, finish what you
have got to say, and then I shall beg leave to
put in a word. It’s only necessary to give
some people rope enough, and they will hang
themselves—that I see!”</p>

<p>“He geed me the keys o’ the buke-cases,”
continued Mrs. M’Kinley, “and bad me tle
hay the books aw dusted, and that there wad be
people here i’ the morn’s morn, at wad undertake
the packing o’ the pictures. And sae he desired
particular at they should be carefully tane
down, and weel wiped ready soon i’ the morn.”</p>

<p>Many were here the ejaculations of astonishment
at such audacity.</p>

<p>“And sae,” continued poor Mrs. M’Kinley,
“I was up we the daw; and aw the next day
was spent we packing, and I helped every thing
we my ain hands; and signs by, I hev hed sick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
a pain i’ my back iver sine, at I’m no fit tle
stand straight!”</p>

<p>No one scarcely could avoid laughing at poor
Mrs. M’Kinley’s thus claiming merit to herself
for the active assistance she had given the
plunderer.</p>

<p>“It’s no a laughing matter,” said she
bitterly. “Bit hear me oot, and I care na
what coms o’ me after! Weel, towerds the
glooming then, sure enough, a boat cam fray
the ship at we had seen nigh to the shore aw
day; and it pot in amang the rocks, just below
the woody cliff yonder. And up the sailor-men
com, bowling through aw the shrubbery walks,
and doon they carried aw the kists and boxes.”</p>

<p>The Earl and Lauson looked at each other:
there was no ejaculation strong enough for this
climax.</p>

<p>“And when they were tacking oot the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
last o’ them,” continued Mrs. M’Kinley, “I
followed mysel through the trees, as far as
the view seat, and sat mysel doon; and by
cam Maister Lauson.”</p>

<p>“I’ll prosecute you if you use my name,”
said Lauson.</p>

<p>“As he cawd himsel at least,” she added.</p>

<p>“So, Mrs. M’Kinley,” he said, “I am going
with the ship mysel, to see all safe,” and he
passed on. “Weel, I looked after him, and after
the kists, and doon on the water, for the moon
was up, and all was clear as day; and the ship
was lying, and I seed the boat put fray the land
and gey toward it; and I seed the kists quite
plain, lifted oot on the boat, and drawd up the
side o’ the ship, ain by ain, till I coonted the last
on them; and then they drawd up the boat also.
A weel, a weel, thought I, and noo it’s aw
ower, it’s been a queer sudden business, amaist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
like tle a dream. And I gade back ti the hoose;
and found Jean sweeping up the strey; and sae
I helped her to shut the doors and the windows;
and we sat doon by the fire, and thought
the hoose mayne lanely like, (the men folk was
no com in tle their suppers) than we had thought
it, aw the years at we had had the care on’t.”</p>

<p>“You should certainly have shut your
doors and windows a little sooner, my good
woman!” said the Earl.</p>

<p>“Here’s locking the stable when the steed is
stolen, with the vengeance,” said Lauson.</p>

<p>“Hear ye te that, noo!” cried Mrs. M’Kinley,
“hoo he threeps me doon; just as if I
was na wratched enu awready. It’s easy prophesying
when the prophesy is oot! I may be
feul, and mad, and aw the rest on’t; bit I’m
no sick a feul at I need to be talt noo, at the
things wad aw be better i’their places, nor i’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
the hands o’a thief and a robber! Bit hoo was
I to ken at he was a thief? Did’na he caw
himself Maister Lauson, and I kent at his
lordship did’na think ye a thief, or he wad’na
ha’ geen ye his business.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be noisy, my good woman,” said
the Earl, but mildly; for he made charitable
allowance for the excited state of her feelings.
“And pray when did all this happen?” he continued.
“Aboot a month syne,” she replied.
“Bit the receipts will show.” “What receipts?”
asked Lauson.</p>

<p>“Did’na I tell ye, at he geed me receipts for
ivery thing?” she replied, with much asperity;
at the same time beginning to rummage her
pockets. “To be sure I hey them!” she murmured;
and the longer she was in finding them
among the varied treasures she successively
drew forth, and in her agitation alternately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
took from one pocket, and put into the other,
the more frequently she repeated, “to be sure
I hey them!”</p>

<p>At length, with trembling hands, after frequent
wiping of her spectacles, which her
fast falling tears as often dimmed, she selected
from the chaos a tied up parcel, containing
receipts for every thing, all signed with the
name of Lauson, and in a hand which was
a very tolerable imitation of his.</p>

<p>Lauson exclaimed against the daring act of
forging his name; swearing that whoever had
done so, should swing for it! “And as for your
long story, madam,” he continued, turning to
Mrs. M’Kinley, “I shall quickly prove it all a
pack of lies! Here are the keys, labels and all, in
my own coat-pocket,” and thence he accordingly
produced them. “Now, it’s a likely
story,” he continued, “if a highwayman-rascal
had been able to get possession of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
out of Mrs. Montgomery’s japan cabinet, at
Lodore House, that he would have run the risk
of putting them there again, after they had
served his turn; and from thence I took them
with my own hands, only three days since.”</p>

<p>Exclamations of wonder here followed. The
Earl cast a very angry glance at poor Mrs.
M’Kinley. She was thunderstruck: she could
not deny that those were indeed the keys, yet
protested that her former statement was notwithstanding
gospel truth!</p>

<p>Affected by her tears and protestations, Julia
declared her belief of poor Mrs. M’Kinley’s innocence,
however inexplicable the circumstances
might be.—“Well,” said the Earl, at
length, “as you, who are most interested,
wish it, we shall at least consider her innocent
till she is proved guilty.”</p>

<p>Mrs. M’Kinley wept like a child, fell at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
Julia’s feet, and begged she would miss-caw
and abuse her, aw at iver she could, and no
break her heart by sick goodness. When the
surprise had at length a little subsided, many
spacious apartments were visited; and the
picture gallery in particular; which, bearing
on its now naked walls the numerous traces of
departed frames of various shapes and sizes,
gave thus a silent and melancholy testimony
of how great a loss had been sustained. Edmund
reminded Lord Arandale, that a clue
might be found to some useful discoveries, in
what Gotterimo had said of the London swindler
having sold to a friend of his, plate, pictures,
coins, &amp;c.</p>

<p>His lordship requested the gentlemen to be
present while he examined the rest of the servants.
The ladies walked on towards the view-seat.</p>

<div class="verse">“Oh! who can speak what all can feel!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span> and Frances, during the straying and
waiting which ensued, happened to wander
into a path which separated them from the rest
of the young people.</p>

<p>“Do you know, Julia,” said Frances, “that
I have become of late a great judge of love?”</p>

<p>“And pray how has that happened?” asked
Julia, trying to laugh.</p>

<p>“Why, it is in consequence of all those new
lovers that you and I have had of late. I now
understand the business perfectly. I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
their ways of looking, and their ways of sighing,
and their ways of lowering the voice.—There
is no describing it, you know; but, in
short, I now understand it perfectly.”</p>

<p>“You will, at this rate, become quite a dangerous
member of society,” rejoined Julia, with
another effort to laugh.</p>

<p>“What a novice I must have been but a few
days since,” continued Frances, “to have been
so taken in as I was by that business between
Edmund and Lady Susan. Why, he no more
loves her (nor ever did,) than I do that stick,
Sir Philip!—That she loves him, indeed, I have
no doubt.”</p>

<p>Julia’s heart beat so fast, that she made several
attempts before she could articulate the
following words: “Then why did he wish her
ladyship to marry him?”</p>

<p>“That is what puzzles me,” replied Frances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
“I think there must have been something
strange in the business; Lady Susan did say
a good deal about his being so modest in consequence
of his want of rank, that she feared
she had been obliged to meet him more than
half way.”</p>

<p>“But why meet her any part of the way, if
he did not wish it?” said Julia.</p>

<p>“He might, you know, have been dazzled by
the great advantages of such a marriage,” replied
Frances. “Or been induced by her ladyship’s
evident preference to mistake his own
feelings. But, however that may have been,
of two things I am now certain: the one, that
he does not love Lady Susan; the other, that
he does love you.” She paused, but Julia
made no reply. “Yes, Julia,” Frances continued,
“I am convinced that he loves you in
the most extravagant, the most passionate, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
most enthusiastic manner! Oh, it is so plain to
be seen in every thing!”</p>

<p>Julia was still silent; but she pressed her sister’s
hand, involuntarily, as if thanking her for
the joyful emotions her words were exciting.
“In short,” continued Frances, “he loves you
with my love and the Marquis’s put together,
if you can imagine what sort of a love that
would make. And I am sure he is breaking
his heart because he knows papa will never
consent to your marrying him. I wish,” she
added, “he did love Lady Susan—don’t you,
Julia?” Julia made no immediate reply. “I
say, Julia,” repeated Frances, “don’t you wish
it was Lady Susan that Edmund loved?”</p>

<p>“Why no—don’t you think it would be very
unamiable of him to love a stranger better than
those he has always loved, ever since they were
children?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>“Unamiable?—Oh, I don’t know,” said
Frances; “but I am sure that loving you will
make him very unhappy!”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you know, because papa will never
allow you to marry him.”</p>

<p>“But—but can’t—can’t we always have a
great regard for each other without—without
marrying?” asked Julia.</p>

<p>“Oh, a regard, yes,” said Frances, “but I
think that poor Edmund would be much happier,
if he loved Lady Susan, and were married
to her, than he will be loving you, and going
to sea, and you marrying the Marquis, or some
such person.”</p>

<p>“That I will never do!” said Julia, with
sudden energy.</p>

<p>At this moment Edmund appeared coming
towards them. Julia hastily put up her parasol,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
though the walk was perfectly shady. The
parasol entangled in every branch, and she
as hastily took it down again.</p>

<p>Edmund now joined them, and offered an
arm to each. Colonel Morven, however, whom
they soon encountered, interrupted this arrangement,
declaring that the walks were too narrow
for three, and requesting Frances to take his
arm. Thus they proceeded, with the rest of
the party, towards the rock conservatory.</p>

<p>Julia was unusually silent, but there was
something in her manner more dangerous, if
possible, than ever to Edmund’s right resolves.
So true is it, that nothing can pass in the
minds of those we love, without our knowing,
at least, that there is something passing. And
of what nature that something was, seemed in
the present instance to be recognised, for he, too,
became silent, yet, during that silence, both felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
a conviction of each other’s affection, stronger
perhaps than any they had before known.</p>

<p>How often, how very often, when distance,
both of time and place intervened, was the
impression received during that, to both, for
ever memorable day remembered, and attempted
to be renewed, severally, by both; how often
inwardly appealed to! How often called upon
to contradict proofs, to bear down facts! But
the misery of this species of evidence is, that
though at the moment the most entirely convincing,
it fades in absence to a mere dream
of the imagination; and while, with strange
inconsistency, we find the greatest aggravation
of our suffering, in the fear that we never did
possess that of which we are thus lamenting
the loss, we still do lament, and with the
bitter feelings of those entitled to complain,
that they have been bereft of all!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>A pretty general meeting of stray couples
now took place in the conservatory, and many
were the observations made on our hero’s
perilous <i lang="fr">couche</i>. After viewing various other
beauties of the place, our party, at length,
agreed that it was time to proceed to Arandale,
which they reached without further adventure.</p>

<p>Their arrival was soon followed by that of
the Marquis of H⸺, and such other guests
as were not of the immediate family circle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> gala of the evening was to commence as
soon as dusk, with illuminations, fireworks,
and various entertainments out of doors, and
to conclude with a masked ball, and unmasked
supper within the Castle.</p>

<p>The woods, as far as the eye could reach on
either side of the grand approach, and also in
the vicinity of the walks leading to the lake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
and to Lady Susan’s cottage were festooned
with coloured lamps, and, at an early hour,
filled with groups of company. Lady Susan’s
cottage itself was illuminated in a simple
style; while, to the great delight of the peasantry
and tenantry, who were permitted to
peep in at the window, her ladyship, dressed
in a rustic garb of stuff, with ribbon tucks,
sat by a bright fire spinning with great industry.
The trees were purposely left without
lamps to a certain distance round, and at
the back of the little thatched building, which,
with its one window lit up as if to contribute
its humble mite to the great public rejoicings,
and its open door emitting a stream of firelight,
had a singularly picturesque appearance.</p>

<p>Julia, supported by Edmund on one side
and the Marquis of H⸺ on the other; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
Frances by Colonel Morven and Sir Philip
Barton Jones, moved, with a crowd of others,
towards the lake, where wonders awaited the
curious spectator. The trees which surrounded,
and even dipped their branches into this
fine sheet of water, were thickly and beautifully
hung with coloured lamps, which, reflected
in seemingly unfathomable depths, shone
like the stars of an inverted sky. The long,
light iron bridge which crossed a narrow arm
of the lake was also illuminated with much
taste and variety. On this our party, with a
number of the select company, took up their
position: the situation being elevated, and
commanding, therefore, a good view of all that
was to be seen.</p>

<p>The Earl had contrived a more animated
representation of the engagement, of which
this fête was to celebrate the anniversary, than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
could have been produced by the hackneyed
mode of transparencies.</p>

<p>He had had a number of pleasure boats fitted
up and rigged exactly as men of war, with their
sides artificially raised, to admit of their seeming
to have one, two, or three tier of guns, according
to their ratings. Of these, two hostile
fleets now appeared on the lake, manœuvring
not far from each other. The admirals, on
both sides, exhibiting their three stern lights,
signalizing their respective squadrons; and,
from time to time, turning their broadsides in
full view, lowering their mimic ports, which
were lighted up within, and making thus an
ostentatious display of their triple row of guns.
Edmund absolutely laughed like a child at the
pompous airs they assumed so well.</p>

<p>“Capital! capital!” he exclaimed. Arthur,
who stood near him, was delighted. Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
were the questions put by the ladies to Captain
Montgomery. He explained every movement
as well as he could for laughing: but to him,
who was accustomed to wield the fearful engines
of real destructive warfare thus imitated,
the proud airs of those little vessels were irresistibly
amusing. While to Julia, and all
such as had never seen any thing greater, the
representation was growing quite imposing.
Indeed, the longer it was gazed upon, the better
became the deception; for the imagination
and the eye both began to allow distance for
the deficiency in size, and, as the engagement
seemed about to commence, the whole moving
scene assumed much of reality and consequence.</p>

<p>Henry, too, as a naval character, had become
the oracle of another circle of ladies at a little
distance; for, on the present occasion, he did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
not feel much inclined to place himself in immediate
comparison with our hero.</p>

<p>Now a few signal-guns were fired: this was
followed by a pause, almost awful: when a
brisk cannonade commenced along the line of
battle, on both sides. One English frigate, in
particular, made herself very conspicuous. But
Edmund’s power of giving information seemed
suddenly quite exhausted; or he was so
much engaged pointing out Admiral Lord
Fitz-Ullin’s vessel, and explaining his signals,
and what had been from the first his
intentions, that he was quite deaf to all questions
respecting the frigate. What
would have become of the unsatisfied and increasing
curiosity of the ladies, it would have
been difficult to say, had not an elderly gentleman
in naval uniform informed them, that the
remarkably situated vessel which had drawn so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
much of their attention, and which might
well be termed the heroine of the day, was
the Euphrasia, commanded by Captain Montgomery.
He then proceeded to eulogize the
gallantry, general character, and even the private
virtues of the said captain.</p>

<p>“You, sir,” he added, addressing Edmund,
“who seem so well acquainted with Lord Fitz-Ullin
and his plans; you must have met with
Captain Montgomery, I should think? There
is not a man in the service whom Fitz-Ullin
values more, or rather perhaps, I should say,
so much.” Edmund, no longer able to feign
attention to other subjects, bowed, and smiled,
at the same time casting an appealing look
around him, as much as to say, “Will no one
release me out of this dilemma?” The
stranger stared. The Marquis good naturedly
interposed, and said, “I believe, sir, you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
been all this time putting Captain Montgomery
very much to the blush.”</p>

<p>“Have I then the honour of addressing
Captain Montgomery?” said our naval friend,
first bowing, then adding, “allow me, sir,” he
shook Edmund most cordially by the hand.</p>

<p>Julia’s enthusiastic heart glowed while it
palpitated. How insignificant now appeared
inherited titles, when compared with the exalted
name Edmund had obtained for himself!
How dimly now shone, mere, reflected hereditary
splendour, unsustained by great actions on
the part of the individual himself, when compared
with the inherent, self-existent glory of
the founder of nobility! She could not love Edmund
better; but henceforward, instead of being
afraid and ashamed of her feelings, she would
be proud of her preference for such a character!
She was sure she should now have courage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
to own it to her father. Then, a sudden
thought of the dangers attendant on so brilliant
a career; dangers which, at the moment,
seemed passing in review before her eyes; dangers
which might, on any day or hour again recur,
struck a panic to her heart, and occasioned an
involuntary movement, which, had she not
checked it instantly, would have been a gentle
pressure of the arm on which she leaned.—Edmund
started—suspended his breathing for
some moments—and then relinquished, with a
blush at his own folly, a presumptuous surmise
which had crossed his mind. But he drew the
arm that leaned on his closer to his side
though so gradually, that there seemed no impertinence,
scarcely intention in the act; or,
rather, it might be supposed to have been induced
by the necessity of taking some such
precaution against the perpetually passing and
re-passing crowd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>The fire of the mimic fleets was now slackening;
the smoke clearing away, and the
French vessels lowering their colours, amid
the shouts of the delighted multitude. Some
of the disabled ships of the enemy were now
seen to drift to a certain distance from the rest
of the fleet, where, instead of burning or blowing
up, in the common mode, they immediately
became the sources whence issued fireworks,
curious, various, and brilliant in the extreme.
During this beautiful exhibition, “Rule,
Britannia!” was played in magnificent style on
board the English fleet: the Earl having
placed, for that purpose, one of his favourite
musicians in each mimic vessel, so that the
little fleet might thus form a complete band.
When the harmonies on the water died away,
they were answered by “God save the King!”
from another band of equally excellent performers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
who were concealed among the woods,
at the distance best calculated for effect. At
these sounds, such of the company as were of
a rank to be indoor guests, returned to the
Castle; while the remaining crowd were entertained
in lit up tents, in which confidential
servants presided: some personating prize
agents, and distributing, not only refreshments
to the people, but the Earl’s bounty, under the
name of prize money. This latter immunity,
however, was extended only to such as had wit
enough to humour the sports of the evening, by
assuming the characters of sailors, or sailors’
wives; for it was Lord Arandale’s object to
add as much as was in his power to the well
merited popularity of a service, so vitally essential
to the glory, and very being of the
nation.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent8">… “Some sport</div>
<div class="verse">Amid the waves, like monsters of the deep,</div>
<div class="verse">And some, among the foliage of the groves.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> now assumed their fancy dresses. Julia,
Frances, and the four Misses Morven, were,
by Lord Arandale’s wish, habited as sea-nymphs.</p>

<p>The principal covering consisted of a long
clinging robe of a bright green. Around the
bust was wrapped white gauze, of the slightest
texture; its folds so arranged, as to resemble,
as much as possible, the crested foam of
ocean; from which, the head, neck, and arms,
seemed, as it were, emerging; while a part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
the same drapery fell over one shoulder, and
floated loosely behind the figure, like the line
of light on divided waters. Through various
parts of the dress was twisted bright scarlet
coral, intermingled with tufts of sea-weeds,
bound together by clusters of the most brilliant
emeralds, seemingly unset, and mixed with
small shells, to give their grouping a natural
appearance; while over all were scattered
costly pearls, innumerable, neither strung nor
set. The feet and ankles, in particular, were
entirely encrusted with ornaments of this
mixed description, as if the accumulation had
been collected, by treading the rocks and caverns
of the fathomless deep, among Neptune’s
hidden treasures.</p>

<p>The very long fair hair of the sisters, worn
quite loose, was peculiarly becoming to this
costume. It hung around in a shower of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
brightness, as though sunbeams were gilding
the light spray with which, sportive movements
through the watery element, thus partially covered,
as with a sparkling yet transparent veil,
each lovely vision. This group did not wear
masks; as they were to assist in receiving the
company.</p>

<p>A small ante-room, the first of the suite
thrown open on the present occasion, was fitted
up to represent a cave. Before its entrance
lay irregular masses of rock, on which were
seated some of the Misses Morven, in their
sea-nymph attire, combing their dishevelled
locks with branches of coral, and singing the
while, like the Syrens of old; till, on the approach
of guests, they would dart off with
looks of well feigned wildness, into the mouth
of the cave; serving thus by their mockery of
flight, as guides to the company. The interior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
of the cave was decorated with coral, growing
out of the crevices of the rock, and budding
with precious stones; slender sea-plants gracefully
pendant from each projecting point; every
variety of magnificent shell, from some of
which seemed to proceed strains of the wildest
music, like the notes of Eolian harps; whilst
others sent forth sounds, resembling the rushing
of mighty waters. Under foot shone
golden sands, promiscuously strewn with pearls
and variegated pebbles; while fragments of
spar and many-sided crystal, containing concealed
lamps, being the only visible sources of
light, gave to the whole a magical effect.
Here, in picturesque attitudes, reclining on
couches of feathery and rainbow tinted seaweed,
appeared the principal figures of the
group. They too were singing, but in sweeter
strains than those without, and in harmony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
with the thrilling breathings, still proceeding
from the shells.</p>

<p>On the entrance of the guests, led in by the
flying Misses Morven, the recumbent nymphs,
gracefully moving their arms in time to the
soft music, by looks and gestures indicated
the way through each recess of the cave to an
outlet at its further extremity, which led into
the next reception room.</p>

<p>The advancing company now found themselves
in a seeming grove of fine old oaks, the
stems of which were entwined, and the
branches festooned with laurel. Triumphal
wreaths of the latter material were also borne
aloft in the joyous dance by a group of wood-nymphs,
wearing on their heads, crowns, and
over their shoulders, garlands of roses, with
which were intermingled leaves, both from the
forest tree and its triumphal wreathings; signifying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
that if we would have the gentler
blossoms of our gardens flourish, the oak and
the laurel must be cultivated.</p>

<p>All who entered the grove in naval uniform,
were conducted by two of the nymphs to an
open space among the trees; where Lady
Susan, in the character of Britannia, was seated
on a beautiful throne, curiously carved in marble
to represent the white cliffs of Albion; canopied
by oaks, and sheltered, on either side,
by a luxuriant growth of laurel; the steps of
the throne, subject waves spell bound to the
stillness of stone, by the presence of their
awful mistress; while on one of them stood
Triton, with his conch at his lips, in the attitude
of awaiting command. The rich harmonies of
“Rule, Britannia!” meantime filled the air every
where; as though the old oaks themselves had
been the performers; for, while the deeper tones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
seemed to come mellowed from within the imprisonment
of their knotted trunks, the softer
ones were heard whispering at large among the
waving of their lofty tops.</p>

<p>Each claimant being led to the feet of
Britannia, she took a laurel wreath from the
hands of her attendant nymphs, and, with a
gracious smile, (a triumphal flourish from the
conch of Triton at the same moment proclaiming
the act,) placed it on the brows of the hero.</p>

<p>In the great room appeared a motley crowd
in the costumes of all the nations under heaven;
so that, on first entering, a traveller’s eye
would have been reminded of the great mart
at Gibraltar.</p>

<p>Lord Arandale had requested that all officers
should wear uniform; Edmund could not, therefore,
without incurring the charge of affectation,
avoid compliance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>Habited, accordingly, in his full dress, or
roast beef coat, and (for things could not be
done by halves) decorated with every star and
garter he had ever won, he made his appearance
in the marine cave. But, having fatally
neglected the precaution taken by the wise
Ulysses against the voices of Syrens, he found
it quite impossible to proceed further; and,
indeed, seemed to be so much at home among
the sea-nymphs, that landsmen, as they passed,
were induced to make many witty comments,
vowing they would never again compassionate
sailors, on the score of their privations.</p>

<p>They had heard, indeed, of mermaids, and
read of Syrens; but, as the former were proverbial
for a very uninteresting peculiarity of
form, and the latter were called, by Johnson,
sea-monsters, they had no idea that the rocks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
and caves of old ocean were inhabited by such
water angels as those they now beheld.</p>

<p>Lady Morven appeared as a Sultana, dressed
in all that could be devised of magnificence.
Having some taste, her ladyship made many
deviations from the hackneyed costume—wearing
one, the groundwork of which, instead of being
of the strong and unbecoming colours generally
adopted, was of white satin; though that
pure fabric was nearly covered with rich highly
raised embroidery of the most brilliant hues,
mixed with gold. Both tunic and petticoat
were deeply bordered and fringed with gold,
and the latter adorned with peculiar richness
up the front, where the opening of the former
displayed it to great advantage. The trowser
and open hanging sleeve were of course not
forgotten, while the numberless claspings, fastenings,
and loopings, bracelets and armlets,
with the superb zone and stomacher, necklace
and crescent, all of jewels, chiefly brilliants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
brought together such a concentration of dazzling
rays, that, when over all was flung a veil
of a material so transparent that nothing of it
could be seen but the beautiful miniature flowers,
embroidered in gold and bright colours,
with which it was sprinkled; those flowers, as
the moving of the invisible drapery caused
them to float around, seemed so many painted
and glittering butterflies, following and fluttering
in the blaze of light emitted by so much
splendour. The bird of paradise too, worn in
front of the turban, and sustained by the crescent
of jewels, was thus so severed by their
lustre from all that seemed tangible, that he
appeared hovering above the bright vision, as
doubtful where to alight. Her ladyship leaned
on the arm of Mr. Graham, who had assumed
the dress of a Sultan, on being assured that it
would not be required of him to do any thing
but loll on an ottoman.</p>

<p>Next appeared a group consisting of an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
blind man, selling matches, and led by a dog—an
excellent figure; a little girl, driving a
wheelbarrow of apples, and calling them vociferously;
and a middle-aged woman, crying
the last dying speech of the latest executed
murderer. Now a group of Circassian slaves;
now a number of naval officers, arm and arm;
now many curious groups of wandering musicians,
ballad singers, and pedlars of various
countries. Herds of foreign peasants; then
came Turks, Jews, May-morning dancers;
these last, children; their queen, a lovely little
creature, leading a lamb by a wreath of roses,
while the gaily decorated pole, with its many
garlands, showered the fragrance of fresh
flowers wherever it passed; then a group of
archers of the Royal Edinburgh Society. In
short, enumeration would be endless. Next
appeared a set of gypsies, one of the figures
very good—an old man with grey hair, and
bent double, leading an excellent imitation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
a small donkey, animated within by a little
boy, and bearing on the centre of the sack,
which was thrown across its back, an infant
in wax, seemingly just able to sit in a little
heap, by help of the old cloak, drawn tight
about it; the deception complete. This group
took the liberty of making a halt for a short
time in the grove, where, under one of the
old trees, they pitched a tent, and from a
projecting branch of another, at a little distance,
suspended a kettle, under which they set
fire to some exquisite perfumes, in the form of
faggots; while one of the youngest and prettiest
of their party sat on the ground, blowing
the embers to a flame, without other means
than her own rosy lips; till, smoke and all,
the gipsey encampment formed a very picturesque
object.</p>

<p>Among the gipsies were some amusing fortune-tellers,
but these latter were all thrown
into shade by the striking figure of an Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
juggler, who came in soon after, quite alone.
He was tall, and dressed in long loose black
robes. Instead of passing on, he paused before
the party in the cave, waved his wand,
and looked fixedly at them. His countenance
was covered by a peculiarly hideous black
mask, through which his eyes flashed with
a supernatural ferocity, assisted by fiery regions
of stained crystal around the apertures.
He made signs that he was dumb, but that he
wished to show Julia her fortune, and immediately
passing his wand between her and
Edmund, waved to all to make a clear space;
then drawing a circle round Julia, pointed to
it and to Edmund, stamped with his foot, and
seemed to forbid his passing the magic boundary.
Edmund made several laughing attempts
to enter the circle, but the juggler as
often interposed his wand and stamped again.
The juggler next taking Henry by the arm,
placed him beside Julia within the circle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
“So, I am to be the happy man, it seems!”
said Henry, carelessly taking the hand of his
cousin. She appeared not to like the jest, and
hastily endeavoured to withdraw her hand, but
he held it fast, giving her a glance which
made her tremble. The juggler now displayed
a ring, which he gave to Henry, who
placed it on Julia’s finger so suddenly, that
she was not aware what he was about to do,
and said, “This is my wife.” At the same
moment, the words, “This is my husband,”
proceeded, or seemed to proceed from the lips
of Julia, in a voice loud and distinct, though
unlike that in which she usually spoke. “No!
no! no!” she cried instantly, in her own
voice, flinging off the ring, and darting out of
the circle.</p>

<p>“Yes! yes! yes!” said a voice from beneath
the ground on which they stood. “Yes! yes!
yes!” repeated voices from within the rocks
on every side, successively, and finally from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
above their heads, till the last sound seemed
lost in distance. The juggler, the while, pointing
with his wand, now here, now there, still
indicating the spot whence the voice seemed to
proceed.</p>

<p>“Was it not you then that said, this is my
husband?” enquired two or three of the young
ladies, turning to Julia. “Nonsense! nonsense!”
she exclaimed pettishly.</p>

<p>“The fellow is a ventriloquist,” said Edmund
aside to the inquisitive Misses Morven,
who seemed never to have heard one before.
At the same time, approaching our heroine,
he offered her his arm, for she seemed to need
support, and he felt, too, secretly delighted by
the visible antipathy to the idea of a union
with Henry, even in jest, evinced by the countenance
and involuntary movements of Julia.
Henry, however, drew her other hand over his
arm, without even asking her permission.</p>

<p>“Well, Julia!” he said, laughing, “thank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
heaven, we are married at last, and publicly
enough this time,” he added, pretending to
lower his voice. “Remember,” he proceeded,
again raising it, and again affecting to laugh,
“you can never be off, in Scotland, after saying
before two witnesses, the awful words—This
is my husband!”</p>

<p>“As I never did, however, nor ever shall
say so,” commenced Julia. Henry interrupted
our heroine, by observing carelessly, “that
reminds me of the lady in the play, who swears
to her father, never to marry her lover, after
she is married to him already.”</p>

<p>This remark, though made with the greatest
levity, shocked Edmund more than he was
willing to confess, even to himself; not that,
at the time, he believed it to allude to any
thing more than the folly which had just
passed.</p>

<p>“How very funny! how very funny!” said
several of the young ladies. “Those sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
jokes are very disagreeable, I think,” said
Julia. “Oh, you don’t think it a subject for
jesting upon?” observed Henry, not at all
disconcerted. “Nor do I, Julia, believe me!”
he added, again affecting to lower his voice.</p>

<p>“The part of the juggler is certainly very
well sustained,” remarked Frances. “Yes,
very well indeed,” said Julia, bowing to the
juggler. “The company seem to be almost
collected,” she added, “so I think we may
now go to the great room, and commence
dancing.”</p>

<p>Henry, thinking he had now sufficiently
plagued Julia, dropped her arm, and offered
his services to two of the Misses Morven.
Edmund could not resist the opportunity of
turning to our heroine, and saying, in a whisper—“for
heaven’s sake, Julia, what does
Henry mean?” “He thinks his absurdity
wit, I suppose,” she replied, without hesitation.
Edmund, at the moment, felt re-assured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
by the ready frankness of her manner, though
long after, and when new circumstances had
arisen, he remembered that the words of her
reply were, certainly, very evasive. One of
the Misses Morven begged to have her fortune
told. The juggler drew the magic circle
around her, and then, with his arms folded,
stood motionless. The unclaimed damsel looked
round to see who was to be her companion.
The juggler waved his wand, as though interdicting
the approach of any intruder. The
spectators began to laugh; and the young lady
got out of her solitary sphere, declaring that
fortune-telling was a very dull amusement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> group at length entered the great room,
where their appearance created a very general
sensation, notwithstanding the immense circle
already formed round a character, which, previous
to their entrance, had been the centre of
attraction. They could not penetrate near
enough to the inner part of the ring to see what
was going on; but were told by a gentleman,
who was politely resigning his own place to
put our heroine a step nearer promotion, that
the character so surrounded was certainly the
best which had yet appeared; and that, though
unmasked, no one could make him out. “It
would have been a thousand pities,” added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
General Morven, whom they now encountered,
“had he worn a mask; for the countenance is
the best half of the jest, he looks so completely
in earnest!” “And so truly anxious to commend
and sell his goods,” said our first informant,
who seemed to be a friend of the
General’s, for they shook hands, and Generaled
and Admiraled each other.</p>

<p>“And treats every one,” rejoined the General,
“so exactly with the degree of respect
which their assumed character claims.”</p>

<p>“The look he gave the woman selling the
last dying speech, would immortalize a new
Garrick!” said the General. “In short the
whole thing is the most complete piece of acting
I ever saw! His expression too of disappointment
and astonishment is so good,
when people, after looking at and pricing things,
walk off without buying.”</p>

<p>Julia and Frances, each leaning on an arm of
Edmund, had by this time, with the assistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
of the General and his friend, got almost to the
front of the circle; whence, who should they
behold standing in the centre, little thinking he
was at a masquerade, and striving heart and
soul to sell his fine things, but our old acquaintance
Gotterimo. He was making his best
bows to Lady Morven, who, in the blaze of
jewels we have already described, was seated
with her Sultan on a splendid ottoman. Ere,
however, we proceed to relate what immediately
followed, we must account for our poor little
friend being found in such good company.</p>

<p>Having on his return to town, made some
discoveries respecting the valuables pawned by
the famous swindler, which, from the great interest
evinced by Mrs. Montgomery in the
mosaics, he thought might be of consequence
to a family that had so greatly befriended him,
he determined to make his next travelling speculation,
attendance on the Ayrshire race meeting,
and at its conclusion to proceed to Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
Arandale’s castle, and give his lordship the
important information. Various accidents so
delayed our little traveller on the cross road,
that he did not arrive at Arandale till many
hours later than he intended. When he came
to the lodge gates, he found them all open, and
the grounds, as he proceeded, covered with
lights, merry groups, &amp;c. &amp;c. “Dis be von
fair,” thought Gotterimo; and he debated with
himself, whether he should not take the opportunity
of doing a little business; but, on second
thoughts, he decided that an out of door fair
held by torch-light, was no place to expose for
sale such valuable articles as those of which
his stock consisted. He continued his way,
therefore, towards the Castle. This he found
also lit up; while beneath its illuminated
colonnade, ascending its steps, and entering its
open portals, he observed a motley crowd,
many of whom, as the seller of matches,
were of much lower degree than himself. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
could, therefore, feel no scruples in entering.
He saw also, in the first hall, many who appeared
prepared to turn a penny as well as
himself; for some had packs on their backs,
some baskets in their hands with perfumery,
pastry, pamphlets, newspapers, &amp;c. He also
saw as many, or more persons, whose appearance
justified the hope of their making costly
purchases. “Dis be de place for me!”
thought Gotterimo. The crowd in the hall
were moving onward, and he moved with them.
“I vill just go fere I see de odder tradge-peoples
go,” he thought. He observed each
person, as they passed a respectable looking
man in black at the foot of the stairs, present
a card. This appeared to him a very regular
and business-like proceeding. He determined,
therefore, to do the like; and taking out one
of his own cards, indicating the articles he had
for sale, and the street and number of his shop
in Bath, he handed it to the butler, who stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
receiving, almost at the same moment, so many
tickets, that the nature of Gotterimo’s deposit
was unnoticed.</p>

<p>He now ascended the great stairs without
further obstacle, admiring as he went the magnificent
carpets, which were spread beneath
his feet on every step; the rich candelabras,
which were held aloft by statues of bronze on
every landing; and the splendid gold-laced
liveries of the servants, who, everywhere,
pointed the way, (gold in any shape, was never
lost on Gotterimo). He passed through the
cave, at a time when it was so much crowded,
that he was not observed by his friends, the sea-nymphs;
nor did he see them, so entirely was
his attention absorbed, examining the pearls
that lay scattered beneath his feet, to ascertain
if any of them were real. Finding them however
to be but imitation, he passed on through
the grove to the great room. Here his ears
were at once assailed with “Oystairs! Oystairs!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
“Who’ll buy my primroses?” “Horrible
and unnatural murder!—most cruel murder!”
“Ripe strawberries! Ripe strawberries!”
“Large apples! Large apples! Large
apples!” And now a light wheelbarrow, impelled
forward with the speed of a velocipede,
by as light a little girl, ran up against him and
almost upset itself, by driving over his feet.
Flower girls courtesied as they passed, offering
for sale bunches of roses. “You be var civil,
my pretty dears,” said Gotterimo, “but I no
give no money for such foolish tings.”</p>

<p>A richly dressed group now came in view;
and Gotterimo thought he might have done
“de great deal of business,” if it had not been
for the ungenerous interference of a noisy,
obtrusive, gentleman’s hair-dresser, while he
offered for sale rouge, stays accommodated to
the shape, lip-salve <i lang="fr">à la rose</i>, Sicilian bloom,
whiskers, eyebrows, moustache, and ⸺’s
invaluable solution for rendering red or grey
hair a beautiful black, displaying for the benefit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
of single gentlemen, a long list of the names
of rich widows and great heiresses, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Soon after this, it was, that our party,
having as we have described, pressed their way
through the surrounding crowd, first discovered,
in the object of general curiosity, their little
friend Gotterimo. He was, at the moment,
as we have stated, making all his best bows
to Lady Morven and Mr. Graham, the splendour
of whose appearance had filled his bosom
with hopes almost as dazzling as the constellation
before which he worshipped. Lord Arandale
now joining the group, a grand denouement
took place. After much ado, the poor little
intruder was got to comprehend, in some degree,
his situation; at least to know that all
the mob which surrounded him, consisted of
ladies and gentlemen; though, why many of
them should choose to appear so little like
such, might not, perhaps, come quite within
the scope of his comprehension.</p>

<p>Gotterimo’s motives for visiting Arandale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
having been, in the first few moments, explained
to the Earl, his lordship, with his good-natured
smile, whispered about among his
friends, the true quality of the supposed well
sustained character. The buzz went round;
and Gotterimo, on his progress through the
rooms, to make his exit, was so often intercepted
by such as wished either to oblige their
noble host, or reward the little man for the
amusement he had afforded themselves, that
our friend’s boxes were quickly cleared of all
their contents, and at prices highly satisfactory
to the vendor; who, on perceiving that he
obtained whatever he demanded, not from the
ignorance but from the whim of the purchasers,
began to think it no great sin to raise the
market a little.</p>

<p>Immediately after the interruption occasioned
by Gotterimo’s adventures, our sea-nymphs
and wood-nymphs, led by Britannia
herself, formed for a peculiar dance, the plan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
of which had been previously arranged. The
figure was to take in the whole of the united
group; and, on a signal given by the music,
the young lady’s respective partners, in whatever
disguise, were to join them as they stood
in their places. Young Lord K⸺ approached
Lady Susan. Sir Philip flew to the
side of Frances. Henry took his place near
one of the Misses Morven. Lord Morven,
Colonel Morven, &amp;c. filled up the party, till
Julia alone stood unclaimed, and, at the same
time, importunately beset for alms by the old
blind man who sold matches. He was bent
double. A profusion of white hair fell around
his patched and ragged shoulders. He held
in one hand his hat, crutch, and the string by
which his dog was fastened, while his other
hand was stretched forth with a beseeching
palm, and, in the piteous and tremulous accents
of extreme age, he craved her ladyship’s
compassion. At length, to humour the jest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
she offered him a small donation. This the
mendicant bent on one knee to receive, grasping,
as he did so, and firmly retaining the
hand that presented it in one of his, while,
with the other, he flung off his disguises, and
sprang to his feet the young and handsome
Marquis of H⸺, unmasked, but dressed for
Neptune, with a crown and trident, and splendid
armour of gold and silver scales. The
plaudits on the occasion were universal.</p>

<p>Edmund, who was thrown out by his absence
from the breakfast table when the engagements
for this dance were being formed, and who,
consequently, was but a spectator, felt his arm
touched from behind. He looked over his
shoulder, and beheld the juggler, who, turning,
made signs to him to follow; he did not,
however, feel disposed to take the hint. The
dumb fortune-teller pressed nearer, and said,
in a low distinct whisper, “I am not what I
seem: follow me, if you wish to know who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
you are!” These words aroused Edmund.
He turned and immediately followed. “It
must be some impertinent jest,” he said to
himself, angry at his own credulity, “yet it is
just possible that—that something, that some
one connected with my strange history may—may
have chosen——.” The dark figure
meanwhile glided as rapidly through the dense
crowd, as if there had been no obstacle to its
free passage. It was with difficulty just kept
in view by Edmund.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> mysterious stranger, our hero still following,
descended the great stairs, crossed the
inner and entrance-halls, and went out at the
great door; then, hurrying past the flaring
flambeaux of the servants in attendance on
waiting carriages, made for a thick grove at a
considerable distance. Arrived at the grove
the figure proceeded some way among the
thickest of the trees. Edmund followed, for
a time, in silence; at length he demanded,
rather angrily, whither the fellow meant to
lead him. The stranger made no reply, but
continued his rapid pace towards the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
remote, and, by there appearing no lights in
that direction, evidently the most unfrequented
part of the grounds. “I will follow no further,”
said Edmund, standing still, after a
quick pursuit of some minutes. “If there is,
indeed, any important communication which
it is necessary should be made to me in private,
we have been long since far enough removed
from all possibility of being overheard.” The
juggler stopped, and faced about. “Young
man,” he said, “you may well believe that
my business here this evening was not to play
the idle mummery you have witnessed. Follow
me, therefore!”</p>

<p>“If your business regards me, name it now,
and here!” said Edmund. The stranger fixed
his eyes on those of our hero, while, beneath
his cloak, he grasped something which Edmund
almost held out his hand to receive, so
sure did he feel for the moment that it must
be a packet of papers containing the information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
he so much desired to obtain. The stranger’s
hand appeared to hesitate. The fellow
spoke again, perhaps to gain time. “The
daughter of Lord L⸺,” he said slowly, his
eyes still fixed on Edmund, “must never be
the wife of ⸺,” he paused, drew a step
nearer, then recommenced, “hereafter you
shall know, of whom; at this crisis there might
be danger in the discovery.”</p>

<p>“I will know all this moment!” exclaimed
Edmund, “else why have I been led here?
I will not be trifled with, sir! If your words
have any meaning, explain them! If they have
none, and that you have dared to make my
most sacred feelings the subject of an impertinent
and indelicate jest, be assured that,
whoever you may be, you shall answer to me
for such conduct.” So saying, he seized a
firm hold of the fellow’s cloak. The ruffian
turned, with a sort of triumphant laugh,
grasped Edmund’s right arm with his left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
hand, while with his right he drew a sword
from beneath his cloak, and made a thrust at
our unprepared hero. Edmund, however, by
a single fortunate effort, disengaged himself,
evaded the first thrust, drew his sword, and
intercepted the second. The villain made
another and another stroke, each of which our
hero parried with equal success; when, the
now infuriated ruffian, with a sudden leap
backward and bound forward, made a direct
lunge at the breast of his intended victim;
which, as our hero at the instant dexterously
sprang aside, came with such force on the
trunk of the tree, in front of which he had
stood but the second before, that the sword
of his ferocious assailant was shattered to the
very hilt.</p>

<p>Edmund, now resting the point of his weapon
on the ground, commanded the man, whom
he considered in no condition to resist, being
disarmed, to return with him to the Castle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
For reply, the juggler drew a pistol from the
belt beneath his cloak, and, thrusting it close
to our hero’s face, fired! The steadiness of
the ruffian’s hand must have been previously
shaken by the force with which his sword had
struck against the trunk of the tree; for the
lighting charge shot perpendicularly upwards,
like a sky-rocket. Throwing the pistol from
him, and cursing it aloud, the villain drew out
the second, levelled it better, and was in the
act of pulling the trigger, when Edmund, by
this time more on his guard, had the presence
of mind to strike its muzzle aside with his
sword. The balls flew through the trees, wide
of the intended aim. The juggler stood a
moment confounded, then eyed Edmund’s
raised arm, as if meditating a dart at it, with
the desperate purpose of possessing himself
of the weapon it held. But the threatening
position of the blade seemed to deter him,
while, the noise of the shots having arrested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
the attention of the nearest group of merry-makers,
their flambeaux were seen, by their
quick movements, to express instant alarm,
crossing and recrossing each other in great
confusion. Then, they separated in every possible
direction, resembling wandering meteors
through the surrounding darkness; while each
moving star was accompanied by a voice,
crying, “Thieves! thieves! thieves!” as they
evidently approached, guided by Edmund’s
directing call, to the spot on which he stood.</p>

<p>The hitherto determined ruffian now turned
and fled. Edmund pursued, and was at first
so close behind him, that he again laid hold of
the villain’s cloak, which, however, now yielded
itself a too easy captive; while its owner
darted round a thick clump of wood, and was
seen no more. All who came up of course
assisted in the pursuit or rather search, but
in vain. From the moment the fugitive was
first lost sight of, no one knew in what direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
to seek him. Some suggested that he
had most probably turned back, favoured by
the shelter of the trees, and throwing off such
of his disguises as might lead to a recognition
of his person, joined the throng of his own
pursuers. Indeed, the multitude of people on
the grounds at the time was so great, that to
have traced among them an unknown individual,
and in the dark too, was a thing so
totally out of the range of possibility, that
the idea was soon given up. On the part of
Edmund, certainly, with infinite regret, for he
was very unwilling to resign the not irrational
hope he had for a short time entertained of
discovering something of his own mysterious
fate; even by finding out who had an interest
in his destruction. A very little reflection,
however, served to convince him, that any
further attempt at pursuit must be perfectly
vain; for if the villain were even seized, how
was he to be identified? no one had seen him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
unmasked, and the very proportions of his
figure had been concealed by his juggler’s
robes. Much disappointed, therefore, our
hero bent his steps towards the Castle, which
the alarm had not yet reached.</p>

<div class="verse">Inconceivable—is he my father?”</div>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Edmund,</span> on his return to the ball room, made
the best of his way, scarcely conscious what
he did, to the very spot he had left; where,
fixing his eyes again on the same object on
which he had been gazing when called away by
the juggler, he fell into a profound reverie.
“What could have been the motive of the
violence offered him? To whom could his existence—to
whom could his destruction be of
so much importance? He was not then too
contemptible to have enemies!” A strange
sensation, approaching to satisfaction, accompanied
the thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>The bustle attendant on changing partners,
reminded him that Julia was engaged to him
for the next set; he put in his claim, and
was soon recalled to a sense of pleasure, for
Julia was leaning on his arm. A shudder
followed, however, as he thought of the mysterious
words of the ruffian stranger. Again and
again he told himself that they had been uttered
but to throw him off his guard. While the
villain spoke, had not his eye been ever watchful?
had not his hand grasped the drawn sword
beneath his cloak? evidently awaiting a moment
of excited feeling, to strike the blow
the more securely. But this solution of the
affair, rational and just as it was, did not suffice
to set his mind at rest. Might he not be
connected with Julia’s family in some way as
disgraceful to himself as fatal to his mad attachment?
Might not some secret agent have
been in consequence employed to put an end
to his miserable existence, lest he should entail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
disgrace and crime on all connected with him?
There were then beings connected with him!
Who were those beings? and where were they?
A thought of horror next crossed his mind:
could it have been a parent who had employed
the murderer’s hand, to blot out shame with
blood? and his heart shrunk from a surmise too
dreadful to be dwelt upon.</p>

<p>It had been previously arranged that the
dance now about to commence was to take
place in another apartment. The couples accordingly
set out; Julia and Edmund led their
own party, while before, behind, and on either
side, moved a consolidated crowd in the same
direction; so that retreat from the relative
position once taken up was quite out of the
question. Our hero and heroine were, consequently,
obliged to keep, for a considerable
time, a very painful situation in the immediate
rear of a talkative party, who, without once
looking behind them, proceeded with the following
dialogue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>“We seem to abound in naval characters to-night,”
observed a gentleman.</p>

<p>“You know it is quite a naval affair,” said
a naval officer.</p>

<p>“True; commemoration of the battle of
⸺.”</p>

<p>“The day is worth remembering, sir!”</p>

<p>“Is Lord Fitz-Ullin here to-night?”</p>

<p>“No, but Captain Montgomery is, I understand.”</p>

<p>“Which is Captain Montgomery?” cried a
lady.</p>

<p>“Which is Captain Montgomery?” said a
second lady.</p>

<p>“Who is Captain Montgomery?” with emphasis
on the word <em>who</em>, said a third lady, who
was, by her own size and weight, making way
for two slim little girls, her daughters, who,
by the pressure of the crowd, were squeezed
into the fat sides of their mother, like the off-shoots
of a bulbous root.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is a question not so easily answered,”
replied an equally fat gentleman.</p>

<p>“Is he any relation of Lord Fitz-Ullin’s?”
enquired some one.</p>

<p>“None whatever,” replied an elderly naval
officer, dryly.</p>

<p>“Lord Fitz-Ullin, then, was merely his patron?”
said a young naval officer. “Merely,”
resumed the elder, “and one half the talent
and spirit, shown by Captain Montgomery,
would have ensured to any young man Fitz-Ullin’s
favour: he is quite enthusiastic about
the service.”</p>

<p>“Fitz-Ullin was a very gay fellow in his
youth,” observed a corpulent gentleman, “and
Captain Montgomery being of unknown origin,
may, after all, be no very distant relation of his
lordship’s.”</p>

<p>“Very improbable!” rejoined the elder officer,
“Fitz-Ullin would give one half his paternal
estates for such a son, even in the way to
which you allude.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>“His lordship has a son?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but Ormond, though a good-natured
fellow, is quite unfit for his profession.”</p>

<p>“Strange that, too!” puffed out the corpulent
gentleman, “for he is strikingly like his
father.”</p>

<p>“There are some officers on before us,”
said one of the young ladies, “I wonder is
Captain Montgomery among them!” “I quite
long to see him, I understand he is so handsome,”
said a third lady. “He seems to be
a general favourite with the ladies,” said the
younger officer: “he is to be married shortly,
I hear, to Lady Susan Morven: luck that! she
has fifty thousand, I’m told.” “To Lady
Julia L⸺, I have heard,” interposed the
elder officer. “I beg your pardon,” said the
fat lady, “Lady Julia L⸺ is to be married
immediately to the Marquis of H⸺.”
“A more suitable match, no doubt,” replied
the elder officer; “but heiresses will sometimes
please themselves, you know; and I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
heard, that Lady Julia L⸺ has been attached
to Captain Montgomery from her infancy;
and that she is determined to marry him in
spite of all her friends, as soon as she shall be
of age.” Just at this particular moment, Edmund
found the impelling torrent press so
weightily against his fair companion, that it
was absolutely imperative upon him to draw
her closer to himself than she had been.</p>

<p>“And Lord L⸺’s great estates,” added
the younger officer, “must go between his
daughters, at his death, whoever they marry;
so the gallant Captain knows what he is about,
it seems.”</p>

<p>“He is accustomed to capturing rich prizes!”
said the corpulent gentleman. A laugh followed
this most original piece of wit.</p>

<p>“The friends,” interposed the plump lady,
“can never consent to a young woman of her
high connexions, throwing herself away upon
a mere soldier of fortune.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have always understood,” observed another
gentleman, “that Lady Julia L⸺ was
engaged to her cousin, Mr. St. Aubin. Indeed
I had it from one who, I think, said that he had
it from St. Aubin himself; or, at least, that St.
Aubin admitted it.”</p>

<p>All this passed among a group, who, though
masked, evidently knew each other. Their
arrival at the apartment they had been all this
time imperceptibly approaching, and the consequent
spreading of the crowd, at length enabled
Julia and Edmund to hasten from the
vicinity of the party, which had so long annoyed
them. Edmund, notwithstanding his causes
for abstraction, was aroused by topics so interesting;
he thought of the strange aside
speeches of Henry, during the mummery of the
juggler, and longed to know how Julia would
treat the subject of her supposed engagement
to her cousin. As to what had been said of
himself, he dare not allude to it, he dare not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
even think of it. At length he ventured to
whisper a sort of introductory sentence, in the
shape of an unmeaning compliment, saying—“How
enviable a lot would Henry’s be, if there
were any truth in the surmises of those people!”
Julia blushed, but made no reply. So
absurd a report did not seem to require contradiction;
and, as she was too innocent to
think any compliment of Edmund’s unmeaning,
his implied question was lost in the pleasure
of hearing him say, that to be preferred
by her would be an enviable lot; nor did she
perceive that her silence and her blush had at
least surprised, if not alarmed him.</p>

<p>The dance now commenced, and put an end
to conversation. It concluded, and Edmund,
as he led Julia out of the set, began to say
something about the necessity he should be
under, of leaving Arandale the next morning
at a very early hour; in pursuance of the
journey, which was this morning so agreeably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
interrupted. At this moment Julia’s hand was
claimed by Lord K⸺.</p>

<p>Previous to sitting down to supper, the whole
assembly assumed an appearance of uninterrupted
splendour. Every coarse or unbecoming
disguise, was exchanged for its very opposite
of elegance, or magnificence; every one
being determined to look as well as possible
unmasked. The young lady who cried primroses,
proved to be the first public singer of the
day; the remainder of the group of flower girls,
the rest of the best set, engaged by Lord Arandale
for the occasion. They performed, during
supper, some of the best scenes of a favourite
opera. A ballet followed, led by the pert miss
of the wheelbarrow, who was an excellent
dancer.</p>

<p>Those, however, who best knew the Earl,
could perceive, notwithstanding the efforts he
made to entertain his company, that during
this evening of unparalleled gaiety and splendour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
there was a slight shade of melancholy
on his brow; and a tendency, while he sat at
supper, to that, scarcely observable, movement
of the head, before mentioned.</p>

it was nearer twelve when the well known
sounds were heard.</p>

<p>Yet late as was the hour, Edmund did not
appear at the breakfast table.</p>

<p>His adventure of the night before with the
ruffian who had obtained admittance in the disguise
of a juggler, having been mentioned by
Lord Arandale to Lady Arandale; by her
Ladyship to Mrs. Morven; by Mrs. Morven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
to the General; by the people on the grounds,
who had witnessed a part of the business, to all
the servants; and by the servants to their

universally talked of. By those we mean, who
could talk; some there were, who could not
trust their lips with the utterance of a single
syllable. Who could thus desire the amiable
Edmund’s destruction, baffled all conjecture.</p>

<p>There was but one rational supposition, the
Earl said. The villain must have been employed
by some one acquainted with those concealed
facts, which had hitherto surrounded
their young friend’s fate with mystery; some
one whose interest would materially suffer by
the development of that mystery; while at the
same time there was most probably some event
about to take place, which threatened to produce
that development.</p>

<p>“Then, Edmund must be still in danger!”
exclaimed Frances, starting upright from her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
seat, and clasping her hands. Julia sat trembling,
and as pale as death; but neither moved
nor spoke. The butler entered with rolls.
He was asked if he could be certain that no
one had been admitted without a ticket. He
was quite certain! He had, himself, taken the
ticket of each person who passed the first hall.
Even the little pedlar had presented a card,
which, happening to be of similar dimensions
to the tickets, he, the butler, unfortunately,
had not examined at the time; and which,
when examined afterwards, proved to be one
belonging to the man’s shop in Bath. This
was the only ticket which was not correct,
of the full number issued. It was strange!
Tickets had not been given to any friends to
give to friends of theirs; with the exception of
a very few to Edmund himself, and to Henry,
for naval officers of their acquaintance.</p>

<p>When the subject had been thus discussed,
in all its bearings, the Earl, who still looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
serious, and even melancholy, said, “I am not
sorry that Captain Montgomery has taken
Arthur with him; it would have been a sad
scene for the poor little fellow! Our friend,
Sir Archibald Oswald,” he added, after a solemn
pause, and looking round the company, “is no
more! The state of his mind will, I trust, acquit
him in the eyes of heaven, as it undoubtedly
must in the judgment of men; but, there is
reason to fear that our unhappy friend has
been accessary to his own death. His body
was yesterday found in the lake by the work
people who were preparing for the illuminations.
Duncan very properly suppressed the
circumstance, till he had communicated it privately
to me; and I judged it best to permit
the entertainment offered to our friends to
proceed, without checking the pleasure of the
company by the introduction of so melancholy
a subject.”</p>

<p>Miss Morven thought that Mr. St. Aubin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
was certainly a very amiable young man: he
showed so much feeling. He actually turned
quite pale, when her uncle mentioned, Sir
Archibald’s body being found in the lake.</p>

<p>Many of course were the exclamations of
pity and surprise. “It will be quite a change
of scene,” continued the Earl, “I must send
for the proper persons; and, if their verdict
is, as I have no doubt it will be, insanity, I
must give my poor friend a suitable funeral.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> account for Sir Archibald Oswald’s disappearance
from Arandale, and the subsequent
discovery of his body in the lake, we must
accompany him in a walk before breakfast, on
the morning after he had evinced so much emotion
the previous evening; first of a furious
description, when Henry’s voice arrested his
attention; and finally, of a tender and subdued
nature, when, on hearing Julia sing, all violence
had not only been allayed, but, unconscious
tears had flowed over his haggard countenance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>

<p>Having retired without supper, and, consequently,
without the excess in wine, which,
with him, too frequently formed the principal
part of that meal, the unhappy Oswald slept
better than was his custom. He rose earlier;
he felt some degree of composure; a lucid interval
was probably approaching.</p>

<p>He wandered into the deep woods that surround
Arandale Castle. The solitude they
afforded was of a cheering and animated kind.
Stately deer crossed his path; birds sang, and
peacocks screamed in every branch, and the
cawing rooks were, as usual, in busy motion, in
and over the tops of all the high old trees.</p>

<p>The path he chanced to take, led him to the
sheet of water before noticed. Our old acquaintances,
the two swans, were slowly sailing
on its calm surface. Half the quiet bosom of
the lake was in deep shadow from the great
trees, which seemed resting the weight of their
branches upon it. The other half shone brightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
in the early sun; and every leaf, every blade of
grass, which, amid so much cover, the rays of
light could reach, was glittering with dew.
The morning air was exhilarating. Oswald’s
broken heart felt soothed by the influence of
surrounding objects. He stood contemplating
the scene with calmer feelings than were common
to him. There was a peculiar stillness in
the moment; the next, the sound of approaching
footsteps fell on his ear. He looked round,
and beheld, as he believed, one who had long
been the object of his search, and of his hatred,
coming towards him.</p>

<p>Oswald stamped on the earth, uttered a yell,
at once of triumph and defiance. His eyes
flashed with the fire of phrenzy; he gnashed
his teeth; his whole countenance became distorted
with the horrible rage of a maniac.
Henry paused! for it was, indeed, this unfortunate
son of a desperate father, whom the
bewildered perceptions of the madman had mistaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
for that father. A father whose very
memory could thus entail on his offspring, not
only the wild vengeance of others, but almost
a necessity in himself to become the perpetrator
of crime, actual, if not intentional.</p>

<p>Henry saw, and endeavoured to avoid Oswald;
but the unhappy being crossed his path,
and seized on his throat with violence, reiterating,
“Villain! villain! villain!” accusing him
of deeds of the blackest dye, and calling upon
him with threats and imprecations to restore
the rights of his son! At first Henry, to do
him justice, only sought to escape; next, only
to defend himself: but when it became evident
that the maniac’s purpose was to put him to
death, and that, with that purpose, was coupled
an insane glee at the immediate prospect of its
fulfilment; and that, added to all this, Henry
began to feel himself actually threatened with
strangulation; his own angry passions kindled,
and he put his strength to the struggle. Oswald,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
however, having at first fastened on
Henry’s cravat, maintained his hold with the
ferocious tenacity of a bull-dog, and pursued
his advantage with the supernatural force
derived from phrenzy. There were moments
when Henry gave himself up for lost! It was
now that he forgot his assailant’s age and
imbecility of mind, and with all the strength
of youthful sinews clasped his arms round the
old man’s waist, and, in a few seconds, brought
him to the ground. Here the sight of Oswald’s
grey hairs lying amid the grass and fallen
leaves might have recalled better feelings; but
even here the poor maniac’s fury was unabated:
his countenance still expressed his horrible intention,
and his hand still grasped the cravat
of Henry. In the latter the instinct of self-preservation
grew each moment more fierce.</p>

<p>The efforts of Oswald, even in this prostrate
position, continued for a time as frantic as
ever. When, suddenly, all became still: the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
hands had relaxed their hold, and Henry gazed
in mute horror and unavailing remorse on a
passive—nay, a lifeless form!—himself as motionless.</p>

<p>“Self-defence is not murder!” he at length
murmured. “Self-defence is not murder!”
he repeated. But no false arguments could
stifle the shocking conviction to which his
suddenly cooled faculties had awakened. The
conviction that a too fatal fierceness had accompanied
the pressure with which he had
held the fallen madman to the earth after immediate
danger to himself had ceased. The
vital breath, suspended by wild excitement
and frantic exertion, might have, would have
returned had not that cruelly continued pressure
impeded the efforts of nature.</p>

<p>Such feelings, however, shortly yielded to a
dread of the consequences of what had happened;
attended thus by, at least, very suspicious
circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>He stood up, and looked all round him. It
was solitude everywhere; and Oswald’s hat
had rolled into the lake. He seized the thought,
drew the body towards the margin, and pushed
it in also.</p>

<p>It sunk, and the water closed over it. Henry
gazed on the spot whence it had disappeared,
till the last spreading circle had melted away;
then, turned to depart. But, started and shuddered
on beholding full, attentive eyes fixed
upon him, as it were observing his movements!
For a moment, he felt detected; but the next,
recovered from his panic, for the eyes were
only those of a stately deer. The animal stood
at a little distance, beneath a tree; his face
turned full round, his head proudly erect, sustaining
the weight of his branching horns.</p>

<p>Henry envied him! And now striking hastily
into a walk, that led towards the Castle, he
debated with himself, in great agitation, whether
he should mention what had happened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
Lord Arandale, pleading the dreadful necessity
of self-defence, against a maniac, who would
else have taken his life; or, whether he should
remain silent, and suffer it to be supposed that
Oswald had drowned himself. That such a
man should commit an act of suicide could not
surprise any one, and Henry, therefore, determined
on the latter alternative.</p>

<p>It was on this occasion that he entered the
breakfast-room on the first morning of the
races, just as Lady Arandale was enquiring of
the butler, if any one had been in Sir Archibald’s
room. It was at this breakfast that
Lady Susan had observed on Henry’s not
having any appetite.</p>

<p>It may now too be imagined what his feelings
of consternation must have been, when,
within an hour after, little Arthur, mistaking
him for Edmund, laid hold of the side of his
coat, and asked him, in a cautious whisper,
where his poor papa was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p>

<p>The body of Sir Archibald Oswald, over
which we have seen the peaceful surface of the
waters close, rose again at the usual time. But
before any one had chanced to visit a place so
sequestered, both it and the hat had been gently
borne along towards a narrow outlet, at the
further end of the lake, and received into the
strait, or pass, which was too confined to
allow of their further progress.</p>

<p>And here they might still have lain, had not
the work people, mentioned by the Earl, found
it necessary to clear this pass.</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
